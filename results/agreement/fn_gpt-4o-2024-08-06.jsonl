Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this task.\n\n### Comparison:\n\n1. **Table Joins and Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** \n     - Joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables on `CDSCode`.\n     - Filters the results where `schools.County = 'Alameda County'`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** \n     - Does not perform a join; it directly filters the `frpm` table.\n     - Filters the results where `County Name = 'Alameda'`.\n\n2. **Calculation of Eligible Free Rate:**\n   - Both queries calculate the eligible free rate as `Free Meal Count (K-12) / Enrollment (K-12)`.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting:**\n   - Both queries order the results by the eligible free rate in descending order and limit the result to the top entry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **County Name Filtering:**\n  - The Ground Truth Query uses `County Name = 'Alameda'`, which is correct according to the schema description.\n  - The Prediction Query uses `schools.County = 'Alameda County'`, which is incorrect because it should use `County Name` from the `frpm` table, not `schools.County`.\n\n- **Join Operation:**\n  - The Prediction Query unnecessarily joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables. The Ground Truth Query correctly operates only on the `frpm` table, which already contains the necessary information.\n\n- **Result Discrepancy:**\n  - The Ground Truth Query produces a result of `1.0`, indicating that the highest eligible free rate is 100%.\n  - The Prediction Query does not produce a result due to incorrect filtering and unnecessary join, which likely leads to no matching records.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary join and filters on the wrong column for the county name, leading to no result. The Ground Truth Query correctly filters and calculates the highest eligible free rate using the appropriate column and table.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 0, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This could lead to discrepancies if the join or filtering conditions are not correctly aligned with the Ground Truth Query's logic.\n\nThe Prediction Query does not correctly answer the question due to the incorrect filtering condition (`SOCType` vs. `Educational Option Type`) and the lack of handling for NULL values, leading to a different result set. The Ground Truth Query correctly filters and calculates the eligible free rates for continuation schools.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 1, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

According to the hint, these are not equivalent, and the correct column to use is `frpm.`Charter Funding Type``.\n- This difference leads to a discrepancy in the results, with the Prediction Query returning 622 rows and the Ground Truth Query returning 624 rows.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses the wrong column for filtering the funding type, which affects the query's ability to accurately answer the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 3, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The question asks for schools with an average score in Math greater than 400. The correct condition should be `satscores.AvgScrMath > 400`, as used in the Ground Truth Query.\n\n- **COUNT Function:**\n  - The Prediction Query uses `COUNT(*)`, which counts all rows that meet the condition. The Ground Truth Query uses `COUNT(DISTINCT T2.School)`, which counts distinct schools. This difference is significant if there are multiple entries for the same school in the `satscores` table. However, the main issue is the incorrect condition on `AvgScrMath`.\n\n- **Logical Error:**\n  - The logical error in the condition (`< 400` instead of `> 400`) leads to a completely different result, as it counts schools with lower scores rather than higher scores.\n\nDue to the incorrect condition on `AvgScrMath`, the Prediction Query does not logically answer the question and results in a different output than expected. The Ground Truth Query correctly implements the condition and counts distinct schools, which aligns with the question's requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition for filtering the average Math scores, leading to an incorrect result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 4, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, they differ in their approach to calculating the eligible free rate.\n\n1. **Calculation of Eligible Free Rate:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** It directly uses the column `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` from the `frpm` table. This column is assumed to represent the eligible free rate as a percentage.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** It calculates the eligible free rate by dividing `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` by `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`. This approach directly computes the rate from the raw counts.\n\n2. **SAT Excellence Rate Condition:**\n   - Both queries correctly apply the condition `(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) > 0.3` to filter schools based on their SAT excellence rate.\n\n3. **Join Condition:**\n   - Both queries correctly join the `satscores` and `frpm` tables on the `CDSCode` and `cds` columns, respectively.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The Prediction Query returns `None`, indicating that it did not find any eligible free rate that met the criteria, or it might be due to the column not containing the expected data.\n   - The Ground Truth Query returns a specific value, `0.9049079754601227`, which suggests that it successfully calculated the eligible free rate from the raw data.\n\nThe key issue with the Prediction Query is its reliance on the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` column, which may not contain the correct or expected data for calculating the eligible free rate. The Ground Truth Query, on the other hand, explicitly calculates the rate from the raw counts, ensuring accuracy.\n\nGiven these differences, the Prediction Query does not logically answer the Question as intended, leading to a different and incorrect result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 5, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's analyze the differences between the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query:\n\n1. **County Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Filters schools in the 'Alameda' county.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Filters schools in the 'Lake' county.\n   - **Analysis:** The question specifies \"merged Alameda,\" so the Prediction Query correctly filters for 'Alameda'. The Ground Truth Query incorrectly filters for 'Lake', which does not match the question's requirement.\n\n2. **Status Type Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Does not filter by `StatusType`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Filters for `StatusType = 'Merged'`.\n   - **Analysis:** The question specifies \"merged Alameda,\" so the Ground Truth Query correctly includes this condition. The Prediction Query misses this condition, which is a significant error.\n\n3. **Number of Test Takers:**\n   - Both queries correctly filter for `NumTstTakr < 100`.\n\n4. **Join Condition:**\n   - Both queries correctly join the `satscores` and `schools` tables using the `CDSCode`.\n\n5. **Count Calculation:**\n   - Both queries use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(T1.CDSCode)` to count the number of schools, which is appropriate.\n\nThe main issue with the Prediction Query is the missing condition for `StatusType = 'Merged'`. This omission means the query does not accurately reflect the requirement to count only merged schools in Alameda. The Ground Truth Query, despite filtering for the wrong county, correctly includes the 'Merged' status condition.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it fails to include the necessary condition for merged schools, which is critical to answering the question accurately.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 7, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Ground Truth Query correctly filters for `T1.`County Name` = 'Fresno'`.\n\n3. **Join Conditions**:\n   - Both queries join the `satscores` table with another table (`schools` in the Prediction Query and `frpm` in the Ground Truth Query) using the CDS code, which is appropriate for matching schools with their SAT scores.\n\n4. **Logical Errors**:\n   - The Prediction Query's use of `schools.Charter = 1` and the incorrect county filter (`Contra Costa` instead of `Fresno`) are significant logical errors that lead to an incorrect result. These errors mean the query does not correctly identify the set of schools that are directly funded in Fresno.\n\n5. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - Due to the incorrect filtering conditions, the Prediction Query results in a count of 0, while the Ground Truth Query correctly identifies 14 schools that meet the criteria.\n\nIn summary, the Prediction Query fails to correctly filter for directly funded schools in Fresno due to incorrect use of the `schools` table and incorrect county filtering. These errors lead to a result that does not answer the question as intended.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 9, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The join introduces complexity and potential for error, as it relies on the `CDSCode` and `cds` fields matching correctly, which is not required by the question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it unnecessarily joins two tables and filters on the `schools` table, which is not needed to answer the question. The Ground Truth Query correctly filters and selects the school with the highest number of test takers directly from the `satscores` table.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 10, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, there are some differences in how they achieve this:\n\n1. **Calculation of Percent Eligible for Free Meals:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** It directly uses the column `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` from the `frpm` table to filter schools with a percentage greater than 0.1.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** It calculates the percentage by dividing `Free Meal Count (K-12)` by `Enrollment (K-12)` and then checks if this calculated value is greater than 0.1.\n\n2. **Table Joins:**\n   - Both queries join the `satscores` and `frpm` tables using the `CDSCode` field, but the Prediction Query also includes an unnecessary join with the `schools` table. This does not affect the result as the `CDSCode` is used consistently across the joins.\n\n3. **Column Selection:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Selects `schools.School`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Selects `T2.`School Name`` from the `frpm` table.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The results differ slightly, with the Ground Truth Result including \"Paramount Academy\" and \"West Campus,\" which are missing from the Prediction Result. This discrepancy suggests that the direct use of the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` column in the Prediction Query might not align perfectly with the calculated percentage in the Ground Truth Query.\n\nThe key issue is the reliance on the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` column in the Prediction Query, which may not accurately reflect the calculated percentage used in the Ground Truth Query. This difference leads to a discrepancy in the results, indicating that the Prediction Query does not fully capture the intended logic of the question.\n\nGiven these observations, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not accurately replicate the logic of calculating the percentage of students eligible for free meals, leading to a different result set.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.3333333333, "eval_index": 11, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

In contrast, the `LEFT JOIN` in the Ground Truth Query will include all schools, even if they do not have a corresponding entry in the `satscores` table, resulting in `NULL` for `AvgScrWrite` if no match is found.\n\n2. **Date Filtering**:\n   - **Prediction Query**: Filters schools with `OpenDate > '1991-01-01'` and `ClosedDate < '2000-12-31' AND schools.ClosedDate IS NOT NULL`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query**: Uses `strftime('%Y', T2.OpenDate) > '1991'` and `strftime('%Y', T2.ClosedDate) < '2000'`.\n\n   The Prediction Query uses a more precise date comparison by including specific days, while the Ground Truth Query uses only the year for comparison. This difference might lead to slightly different results, especially for schools opened or closed exactly on the boundary dates.\n\n3. **Handling of NULL Values**:\n   - The Prediction Query explicitly checks for `ClosedDate IS NOT NULL` when filtering for closed schools, which is not present in the Ground Truth Query. This could lead to different results if there are schools with `NULL` in `ClosedDate`.\n\n4. **Output Columns**:\n   - Both queries select the same columns: `School`, `AvgScrWrite`, and `Phone`.\n\n5. **Result Differences**:\n   - The Prediction Result has significantly fewer rows (767) compared to the Ground Truth Result (8217). This discrepancy is primarily due to the use of `INNER JOIN` in the Prediction Query, which excludes schools without SAT scores.\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses an `INNER JOIN` instead of a `LEFT JOIN`, which excludes schools without SAT scores, leading to a significantly different result set. Additionally, the handling of date filtering and `NULL` values in `ClosedDate` further contributes to the differences.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 13, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This is a critical difference because the task requires finding cities with the lowest total enrollment, not individual records with the lowest enrollment.\n   \n2. **Grouping**: The Ground Truth Query groups the results by city, ensuring that the enrollment numbers are summed for each city. The Prediction Query lacks this grouping, leading to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Result Set**: The Ground Truth Query returns 5 cities, while the Prediction Query returns only 3 cities. This discrepancy is due to the lack of aggregation and grouping in the Prediction Query.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it fails to aggregate enrollment numbers by city, which is essential for determining the cities with the lowest total enrollment. Instead, it simply orders individual records by enrollment, leading to an incorrect and incomplete result set.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 14, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This part is consistent in both queries.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query orders the schools by `Enrollment (K-12)` in descending order and uses `LIMIT 9, 2` to select the 10th and 11th schools.\n   - The Prediction Query also orders by `Enrollment (K-12)` in descending order but uses `LIMIT 10, 2`. This is incorrect because `LIMIT 10, 2` skips the first 10 records and selects the 11th and 12th schools, not the 10th and 11th.\n\n4. **Join Operation**:\n   - The Prediction Query includes a `JOIN` with the `schools` table, but this join is unnecessary for the task as the required data is already present in the `frpm` table. The Ground Truth Query correctly does not include this join.\n\n5. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The difference in the `LIMIT` clause results in different schools being selected, leading to different eligible free rates being calculated. This is why the results of the two queries differ.\n\nThe Prediction Query incorrectly uses `LIMIT 10, 2` instead of `LIMIT 9, 2`, which results in selecting the wrong schools. This is a significant error as it directly affects the query's ability to answer the question correctly.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 15, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The conversion to percentage is a valid transformation of the rate.\n\n4. **SQLite3 Compatibility**:\n   - Both queries are compatible with SQLite3, and the operations performed are valid within this context.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query is correct in terms of logic and functionality.

The Ground Truth Query explicitly casts `NumGE1500` as `REAL` to ensure floating-point division, while the Prediction Query multiplies `NumGE1500` by `1.0` to achieve the same effect. Both methods are valid for ensuring floating-point division in SQLite.\n\n3. **Filtering**:\n   - The Prediction Query includes a condition `satscores.NumTstTakr != 0` to avoid division by zero, which is a good practice. The Ground Truth Query does not explicitly include this condition, but it is implied that `NumTstTakr` should not be zero for a valid excellence rate calculation.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**:\n   - Both queries order the results by the calculated excellence rate in ascending order and limit the result to the first entry, which corresponds to the school with the lowest excellence rate.\n\n5. **Selected Columns**:\n   - The Prediction Query selects `Street, City, Zip, State`, while the Ground Truth Query selects `Street, City, State, Zip`. The order of columns in the SELECT clause does not affect the correctness of the query in terms of answering the question.\n\n6. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The Prediction Result and Ground Truth Result differ in the order of the `State` and `Zip` columns. However, this does not affect the logical correctness of the query in terms of providing the complete address.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query logically answers the question by providing the complete address of the school with the lowest excellence rate. The difference in column order in the result does not impact the correctness of the query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 17, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to understand the differences and determine if the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n### Comparison of Queries\n\n1. **Common Elements:**\n   - Both queries perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `schools` and `satscores` tables using the `CDSCode` and `cds` columns, respectively.\n   - Both queries filter the results to include only schools in the \"Fresno Unified\" district.\n   - Both queries order the results by `AvgScrRead` in ascending order and limit the result to the first entry, which should correspond to the school with the lowest average reading score.\n\n2. **Differences:**\n   - **Handling of NULL Values:**\n     - The Ground Truth Query includes a condition `T1.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL` to ensure that only non-null average reading scores are considered. This is crucial because if there are null values, they could affect the ordering and result.\n     - The Prediction Query does not include this condition, which means it might incorrectly consider a school with a null reading score as having the lowest score.\n\n3. **Impact of Differences:**\n   - The absence of the `IS NOT NULL` condition in the Prediction Query is significant. If there are any null values in the `AvgScrRead` column, the Prediction Query might return a school with a null score instead of the one with the lowest actual score. This would lead to an incorrect result, as seen in the differing results between the Prediction and Ground Truth Queries.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it fails to handle null values in the `AvgScrRead` column, which can lead to an incorrect determination of the school with the lowest average reading score. The Ground Truth Query correctly includes a condition to exclude null values, ensuring accurate results.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 18, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Instead, it ranks schools across all counties, which does not meet the question's requirements.\n- The Prediction Query incorrectly filters for non-virtual schools, whereas the question asks for virtual schools.\n- The Ground Truth Query correctly implements the partitioning by county and ranks the schools within each county, providing a list of top 5 virtual schools per county.\n\nDue to these significant differences, the Prediction Query does not logically answer the question and produces incorrect results.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 19, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This is crucial because if `AvgScrMath` is null, the sum used for ordering could be incorrect or misleading.\n   - **Columns Selected**: Both queries select the same columns: `AvgScrMath` and `County`.\n   - **Result Discrepancy**: The Prediction Query returns `None` for `AvgScrMath`, indicating it might have selected a row where `AvgScrMath` is null, which the Ground Truth Query avoids by its null check.\n\n3. **Impact of Differences**:\n   - The absence of a null check in the Prediction Query can lead to selecting a school with a null `AvgScrMath`, which does not logically answer the question of finding the average math score.\n   - The Ground Truth Query correctly filters out such cases, ensuring the result is meaningful and accurate.\n\nGiven these observations, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not handle null values properly, leading to a result that does not logically answer the question. The Ground Truth Query correctly addresses this issue and provides a valid result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 20, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's analyze the differences between the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n- The Ground Truth Query calculates the ratio by using a `SUM` with `CASE` statements to count the number of merged schools for each district type (Unified and Elementary) directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n- It filters the schools by `StatusType = 'Merged'` and `County = 'Orange'`.\n- It uses `DOC = 54` for Unified School Districts and `DOC = 52` for Elementary School Districts.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n- The Prediction Query uses `INNER JOIN` operations to filter the schools based on `DOC` values for Unified and Elementary School Districts.\n- It filters the schools by `StatusType = 'Merged'` and `County = 'Orange County'`.\n- It uses `COUNT(DISTINCT df2.CDSCode)` for Unified School Districts and `COUNT(DISTINCT df3.CDSCode)` for Elementary School Districts.\n\n### Differences and Issues\n1. **County Name Filtering**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `County = 'Orange'`, while the Prediction Query uses `County = 'Orange County'`. This discrepancy in the county name filtering leads to different results, as they are likely referring to different sets of data.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses a straightforward `SUM` with `CASE` statements to count the schools, which is efficient and directly answers the question.\n   - The Prediction Query uses `INNER JOIN` operations, which are unnecessary for this task and complicate the query. The use of `DISTINCT` is also not needed since the `CDSCode` should already be unique for each school.\n\n3. **Logical Correctness**:\n   - The Prediction Query's use of `INNER JOIN` and `DISTINCT` does not logically align with the task of simply counting schools based on `DOC` values. It introduces complexity without adding value to the solution.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The Prediction Query returns `None`, indicating a failure to compute the correct ratio, likely due to the incorrect filtering and unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it fails to logically and correctly compute the ratio due to incorrect filtering and unnecessary complexity. The Ground Truth Query provides a correct and efficient solution to the problem.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 22, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this task.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n- **Logic**: The query first filters schools with `StatusType = 'Closed'`. It then groups the results by `County` and uses a `HAVING` clause to compare the count of closed schools in each county to the maximum count of closed schools in any county. This maximum count is determined by a subquery.\n- **Output**: The query returns the county, school name, and closure date for the county with the most closed schools.\n- **Issue**: The `GROUP BY` clause in the main query is incorrect because it groups by `County`, which results in only one school being returned per county. This is not the intended behavior, as we want all schools in the county with the most closures.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n- **Logic**: The query first identifies the county with the most closed schools using a subquery. It then selects all schools in that county with `StatusType = 'Closed'`, ensuring that the school name is not null.\n- **Output**: The query returns all schools in the county with the most closed schools, along with their closure dates.\n- **Correctness**: This query correctly identifies all schools in the county with the most closures.\n\n### Comparison\n- **Grouping and Filtering**: The Prediction Query incorrectly uses `GROUP BY` on `County`, which limits the result to one school per county. The Ground Truth Query correctly identifies all schools in the county with the most closures.\n- **Result Set**: The Prediction Query returns only one school, while the Ground Truth Query returns all schools in the county with the most closures.\n- **Logical Error**: The Prediction Query's use of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` results in an incorrect and incomplete result set.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query does not logically answer the question because it fails to return all schools in the county with the most closures. The use of `GROUP BY` on `County` is a significant error that affects the query's ability to provide the correct result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 23, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This is crucial because null values could affect the ordering and result in an incorrect school being selected.\n   - The Prediction Query lacks this condition, which means it could potentially include rows with null `AvgScrRead` values, leading to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting:**\n   - Both queries use `ORDER BY AvgScrRead ASC LIMIT 1` to select the school with the lowest average reading score. However, due to the absence of the null check in the Prediction Query, the ordering might not function as intended if null values are present.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The Prediction Result and Ground Truth Result differ, indicating that the Prediction Query likely selected a school with a null or incorrect `AvgScrRead` value due to the missing null check.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not handle null values in the `AvgScrRead` column, which is a critical aspect of the question. This omission leads to a different and incorrect result compared to the Ground Truth Query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 25, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

It uses an `INNER JOIN` to match records from the `schools` and `satscores` tables based on the `CDSCode` and `cds` columns, respectively.\n   - The result is a single aggregated value representing the total number of test takers in Fresno.\n\n2. **Ground Truth Query:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT T1.NumTstTakr \n   FROM satscores AS T1 \n   INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode \n   WHERE T2.MailCity = 'Fresno'\n   ```\n   - This query retrieves individual `NumTstTakr` values for each school in Fresno without aggregation. It also uses an `INNER JOIN` to match records from the `schools` and `satscores` tables.\n   - The result is a list of `NumTstTakr` values for each school in Fresno.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The Prediction Query provides the total number of test takers by summing up the `NumTstTakr` values, which directly answers the question of \"how many test takers are there\" in total.\n- The Ground Truth Query lists the number of test takers for each school individually, which does not directly answer the question of the total number of test takers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Prediction Query correctly answers the question by providing the total number of test takers in Fresno, while the Ground Truth Query provides a breakdown by school. The difference in results is due to the aggregation in the Prediction Query, which is appropriate for the question asked.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.6666666667, "eval_index": 26, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this question.\n\n1. **Filtering by State:**\n   - Both queries correctly filter schools with a mailing state address in California using `MailState = 'CA'`.\n\n2. **Filtering by Status:**\n   - Both queries correctly filter for active schools using `StatusType = 'Active'`.\n\n3. **Filtering by Location:**\n   - The Ground Truth Query filters schools by the city name using `City = 'San Joaquin'`.\n   - The Prediction Query filters schools by the county name using `County = 'San Joaquin'`.\n\n**Key Difference:**\n- The main difference lies in how the location is filtered. The Ground Truth Query uses the `City` column to filter for schools specifically in the city of San Joaquin, while the Prediction Query uses the `County` column to filter for schools in San Joaquin County. This difference in filtering criteria leads to a significant discrepancy in the results, as the city of San Joaquin is not the same as San Joaquin County.\n\n**Impact of the Difference:**\n- The Prediction Query does not correctly answer the question because it counts schools in the entire San Joaquin County rather than just the city of San Joaquin. This results in a much higher count (261) compared to the Ground Truth Result (2), which accurately reflects the number of active schools in the city of San Joaquin.\n\nGiven this analysis, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it fails to filter by the correct geographical location as specified in the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 27, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to understand the differences:\n\n1. **Query Structure and Logic:**\n   - Both queries aim to join the `schools` and `satscores` tables using the `CDSCode` and `cds` columns, respectively.\n   - Both queries order the results by `AvgScrWrite` in descending order to find the school with the 333rd highest average writing score.\n\n2. **LIMIT Clause:**\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `LIMIT 332, 1`, which means it skips the first 332 rows and returns the 333rd row.\n   - The Prediction Query uses `LIMIT 333, 1`, which skips the first 333 rows and returns the 334th row.\n\n3. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The difference in the LIMIT clause results in the Prediction Query returning the phone number and extension for the 334th highest average writing score instead of the 333rd.\n   - This discrepancy leads to different results between the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query.\n\n4. **Significance of the Difference:**\n   - The difference in the LIMIT clause is significant because it directly affects which row is selected from the ordered list. The Prediction Query does not correctly identify the school with the 333rd highest average writing score due to this off-by-one error.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not accurately answer the question due to the incorrect use of the LIMIT clause.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 28, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this question.\n\n### Prediction Query\n```sql\nSELECT Website FROM schools WHERE (AdmFName1 = 'Mike' AND AdmLName1 = 'Larson') OR (AdmFName2 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName2 = 'Alvarez')\n```\n\n### Ground Truth Query\n```sql\nSELECT Website FROM schools WHERE (AdmFName1 = 'Mike' AND AdmLName1 = 'Larson') OR (AdmFName1 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName1 = 'Alvarez')\n```\n\n### Comparison\n1. **Condition for Mike Larson**:\n   - Both queries correctly filter for schools where the first administrator's name is Mike Larson: `(AdmFName1 = 'Mike' AND AdmLName1 = 'Larson')`.\n\n2. **Condition for Dante Alvarez**:\n   - **Prediction Query**: It checks if Dante Alvarez is the second administrator: `(AdmFName2 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName2 = 'Alvarez')`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query**: It checks if Dante Alvarez is the first administrator: `(AdmFName1 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName1 = 'Alvarez')`.\n\n### Significance of Differences\n- The key difference lies in how the queries check for Dante Alvarez. The Prediction Query looks for Dante Alvarez as the second administrator, while the Ground Truth Query looks for him as the first administrator.\n- This difference is significant because it affects the number of results returned. The Ground Truth Query returns two websites, indicating that there are schools where Dante Alvarez is the first administrator. The Prediction Query returns only one website, missing the case where Dante Alvarez is the first administrator.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not fully capture the conditions specified in the question. It fails to consider the possibility of Dante Alvarez being the first administrator, which leads to an incomplete result set.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 30, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The inclusion of extra columns does not affect the correctness of the query in terms of answering the question.\n\n5. **Result Differences**:\n   - The difference in the number of columns between the Prediction Result and the Ground Truth Result is due to the additional administrator name columns in the Prediction Query. However, this does not affect the logical correctness of the query in answering the question.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query is logically correct as it answers the question by providing the names of administrators, the school, and the city. The extra columns for additional administrators do not detract from its correctness.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 31, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The query is structured as follows:\n- It counts the number of schools in Santa Clara County that are both charter schools and locally funded.\n- It divides this count by the total number of charter schools in Santa Clara County.\n- The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\nThe Ground Truth Query calculates the ratio of locally funded charter schools to all other types of charter school funding in Santa Clara County. The query is structured as follows:\n- It uses a `CASE` statement to sum the number of locally funded charter schools.\n- It uses another `CASE` statement to sum the number of charter schools that are not locally funded.\n- It divides the sum of locally funded schools by the sum of non-locally funded schools and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Denominator**:\n   - **Prediction Query**: Uses the total number of charter schools in Santa Clara County as the denominator.\n   - **Ground Truth Query**: Uses the number of charter schools that are not locally funded as the denominator.\n\n2. **Numerator**:\n   - Both queries correctly count the number of locally funded charter schools in Santa Clara County.\n\n3. **Logical Interpretation**:\n   - The Prediction Query calculates the percentage of locally funded schools out of all charter schools.\n   - The Ground Truth Query calculates the percentage of locally funded schools compared to non-locally funded schools.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query does not logically answer the question as intended by the Ground Truth Query. The Ground Truth Query is looking for a ratio of locally funded schools to non-locally funded schools, whereas the Prediction Query calculates the percentage of locally funded schools out of all charter schools. This difference in the denominator leads to a different interpretation and result.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect for the given question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 32, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this task.\n\n### Comparison of Queries\n\n1. **Table Joins and Conditions:**\n   - Both queries join the `schools` and `frpm` tables on the `CDSCode` column, which is correct for associating school information with enrollment data.\n   - Both queries filter for schools in the city of Fremont (`schools.City = 'Fremont'`) and for schools with an `EdOpsCode` of 'SSS', which corresponds to State Special Schools.\n\n2. **Academic Year Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Filters for `frpm.`Academic Year` = 2014`. This implies it is looking for data specifically for the year 2014.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses `T1.`Academic Year` BETWEEN 2014 AND 2015`, which includes both the 2014 and 2015 academic years.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - Both queries select the `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` column, which is the correct column to answer the question.\n\n### Analysis of Differences\n\n- The main difference lies in how the academic year is filtered:\n  - The Prediction Query only considers the year 2014, while the Ground Truth Query considers both 2014 and 2015. This difference is significant because the question asks for the 2014-2015 academic year, which typically includes both years.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not account for the full academic year of 2014-2015, as specified in the question. It only retrieves data for the year 2014, missing any relevant data from 2015. This results in a different output compared to the Ground Truth Query, which correctly includes both years.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 34, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This difference in representation is acceptable as long as the logic is correct.\n\n4. **Logical Correctness:**\n   - The Prediction Query is logically correct because it retrieves the required information using the precomputed column `Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (Ages 5-17)`. The difference in representation (decimal vs. percentage) does not affect the logical correctness of the query.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query correctly answers the question by using the precomputed percentage from the `frpm` table, even though it presents the result in a different format. The difference in the result is due to the representation of the percentage, not a logical error in the query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 35, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Additionally, it asks for the number of cities offering such a grade span and the number of schools in each city serving this grade span.\n\n2. **Prediction Query Analysis:**\n   - The Prediction Query selects cities and counts the number of schools that offer a magnet program serving a grade span of K-8. It groups the results by city.\n   - It does not consider the condition of \"Multiple Provision Types\" from the `frpm` table, which is a critical part of the question.\n   - The query only uses the `schools` table and does not join with the `frpm` table to filter schools based on the `NSLP Provision Status`.\n\n3. **Ground Truth Query Analysis:**\n   - The Ground Truth Query correctly joins the `schools` table with the `frpm` table on `CDSCode`.\n   - It applies the necessary conditions: the school must offer a magnet program (`Magnet = 1`), serve a grade span of K-8 (`GSoffered = 'K-8'`), and have a `NSLP Provision Status` of 'Multiple Provision Types'.\n   - It groups the results by city, which aligns with the requirement to list the number of cities and the number of schools in each city.\n\n4. **Significance of Differences:**\n   - The Prediction Query fails to filter schools based on the `NSLP Provision Status` of 'Multiple Provision Types', which is a crucial part of the question. This omission leads to a broader set of results that do not meet the full criteria specified in the question.\n   - The Ground Truth Query correctly implements all conditions and joins necessary to answer the question accurately.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not logically answer the question due to missing conditions related to the `NSLP Provision Status`. It does not join with the `frpm` table, which is essential for filtering schools based on the provision type.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "challenging", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 39, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This join is not present in the Prediction Query. However, the question does not explicitly require data from the `frpm` table, so the join might not be necessary unless it affects the filtering or the result.\n\n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - The Prediction Query selects only `AdmEmail1`, while the Ground Truth Query selects both `AdmEmail1` and `AdmEmail2`. The question asks for valid e-mail addresses, which could imply multiple addresses. The Prediction Query might miss additional valid e-mail addresses by not selecting `AdmEmail2`.\n\n3. **Filtering Conditions**:\n   - Both queries filter by `County`, `District`, `OpenDate`, `SOC`, and `DOC`. However, the Ground Truth Query uses `City = 'San Bernardino'`, while the Prediction Query uses `District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'`. The question specifies \"City of San Bernardino City Unified,\" which could be interpreted as either a city or a district, but the Ground Truth Query's use of `City` seems more aligned with the question's wording.\n\n4. **Date Filtering**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `strftime('%Y', T2.OpenDate) BETWEEN '2009' AND '2010'`, which effectively filters the same date range as the Prediction Query's `BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2010-12-31'`.\n\n5. **Result Differences**:\n   - The Prediction Result contains only one e-mail address, while the Ground Truth Result contains two. This discrepancy is due to the Prediction Query not selecting `AdmEmail2`.\n\nOverall, the Prediction Query does not fully answer the question as it potentially misses additional valid e-mail addresses by not considering `AdmEmail2`. Additionally, the lack of a join with the `frpm` table might not affect the result directly, but the filtering by `City` instead of `District` in the Ground Truth Query seems more aligned with the question's wording.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not fully capture all valid e-mail addresses as required by the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "challenging", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 42, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's break down the queries:\n\n1. **Join Operation**: Both queries perform an INNER JOIN between the `schools` and `satscores` tables using the `CDSCode` from `schools` and `cds` from `satscores`. This join operation is correct and necessary to combine the relevant data from both tables.\n\n2. **Ordering and Limiting**: Both queries order the results by `NumGE1500` in descending order and limit the result to the top entry. This ensures that they both select the school with the highest number of test takers who received SAT scores of at least 1500.\n\n3. **Column Selection**:\n   - The Prediction Query selects `schools.School` and `schools.AdmEmail1`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query selects `T2.AdmEmail1` and `T2.School`.\n\nThe difference lies in the order of the columns in the SELECT clause. The Prediction Query lists the school name first, followed by the administrator's email, while the Ground Truth Query lists the administrator's email first, followed by the school name. This difference in column order does not affect the logical correctness of the query in terms of answering the question.\n\nThe question asks for both the administrator's email address and the name of the school, without specifying the order in which they should be presented. Therefore, both queries correctly answer the question, and the difference in column order is not significant.\n\nGiven these observations, the Prediction Query is correct in terms of logic and functionality.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 43, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, it does not directly compare the two averages to determine which year has a higher percentage.\n\n2. **Ground Truth Query:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT DISTINCT IIF(AVG(A13) > AVG(A12), '1996', '1995') FROM district\n   ```\n   - This query calculates the average unemployment ratio for both years and uses the `IIF` function to directly compare the two averages. It returns '1996' if the average for 1996 is higher, otherwise '1995'.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The Prediction Query provides the average unemployment ratios for both years but does not perform the comparison to determine which year has the higher percentage. It leaves the decision to the user to interpret the results.\n- The Ground Truth Query directly answers the question by comparing the averages and returning the year with the higher average unemployment ratio.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Prediction Query does not fully answer the question as it does not perform the necessary comparison to determine which year has a higher percentage. It only provides the averages, requiring additional interpretation to reach the final answer. Therefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect in the context of the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 45, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, this logic is incorrect because `MAX(client.birth_date)` would give the most recent birth date, not the oldest.

This part is correct in terms of finding the lowest average salary.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** It does not explicitly find the lowest average salary but assumes the district of the oldest female client has the lowest average salary.\n\n3. **Gap Calculation:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** It calculates the gap as `MAX(district.A11) - MIN(district.A11)` but does so within the context of each account due to the `GROUP BY account.account_id`. This is incorrect because it should calculate the gap across all districts, not per account.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** It correctly calculates the gap across all districts using `(SELECT MAX(A11) - MIN(A11) FROM district)`.\n\n4. **Account Number:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** It lists account numbers but does so incorrectly due to the flawed logic in identifying the oldest female client.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** It correctly identifies the account number of the oldest female client with the lowest average salary.\n\nThe Prediction Query has several critical errors:\n- It incorrectly identifies the oldest female client.\n- It calculates the gap incorrectly by grouping by account.\n- It does not correctly match the logic required to find the account number of the oldest female client with the lowest average salary.\n\nDue to these significant logical errors, the Prediction Query does not correctly answer the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "challenging", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 46, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's analyze both the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to understand their differences and determine if the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n1. **Joins**: The Prediction Query correctly joins the `account`, `disp`, `client`, and `district` tables to access the necessary information.\n2. **Youngest Client**: The condition `client.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(client.birth_date) FROM client)` is used to find the youngest client. This is correct because a higher birth date indicates a younger person.\n3. **Highest Average Salary**: The condition `district.A11 = (SELECT MAX(district.A11) FROM district)` is used to find the district with the highest average salary. This is also correct as A11 refers to the average salary.\n4. **Logical Error**: The query attempts to find clients who are both the youngest and from the district with the highest average salary. However, it does not ensure that the youngest client is from the district with the highest average salary. It independently checks for the youngest client and the highest average salary, which may not necessarily be the same client.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n1. **Joins**: Similar to the Prediction Query, it joins the necessary tables.\n2. **Youngest Client**: The subquery `(SELECT client_id FROM client ORDER BY birth_date DESC LIMIT 1)` correctly identifies the youngest client by ordering the birth dates in descending order and selecting the top one.\n3. **Highest Average Salary**: The query groups by `T4.A11` and `T1.account_id`, which ensures that the account is associated with the highest average salary district.\n4. **Correct Logic**: The Ground Truth Query ensures that the account belongs to the youngest client and is associated with the highest average salary.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query does not correctly ensure that the youngest client is from the district with the highest average salary. It independently checks for the youngest client and the highest average salary, which may not necessarily be the same client. The Ground Truth Query correctly handles this by ensuring the account is associated with both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 47, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This is a significant difference because the data source is different, which directly affects the result.\n   \n2. **Date Filtering**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses a `BETWEEN` clause to filter dates within the year 1995, while the Ground Truth Query uses `STRFTIME` to extract the year and filter it. Both methods are logically correct for filtering dates within 1995, but the difference in tables makes this irrelevant.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The Prediction Query returns `3006`, while the Ground Truth Query returns `9`. This discrepancy is due to the different tables being queried.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it queries the wrong table (`account` instead of `trans`). The task requires finding the earliest trading date, which is likely recorded in the `trans` table, not the `account` table. This error leads to a different and incorrect result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 49, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this task.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n- **Tables and Joins**: The Prediction Query joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables using the `cdscode` column. This join is used to filter schools of type 'Continuation School'.\n- **Filtering**: The query filters for schools where `schools.school` is 'Continuation School'.\n- **Calculation**: It calculates the free rate as `free meal count (ages 5-17)` divided by `enrollment (ages 5-17)`.\n- **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by the calculated `free_rate` in ascending order, and the top 3 are selected.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n- **Tables and Joins**: The Ground Truth Query only uses the `frpm` table and does not perform any joins.\n- **Filtering**: It filters for rows where `Educational Option Type` is 'Continuation School'.\n- **Calculation**: It calculates the free rate in the same way as the Prediction Query.\n- **Null Handling**: It explicitly checks that the calculated free rate is not null.\n- **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by the calculated free rate in ascending order, and the top 3 are selected.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Table Usage**: The Prediction Query uses a join with the `schools` table, while the Ground Truth Query only uses the `frpm` table. This difference could lead to different results if the join condition or the filtering criteria in the `schools` table do not match the `Educational Option Type` in the `frpm` table.\n2. **Filtering Criteria**: The Prediction Query filters based on `schools.school = 'Continuation School'`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `Educational Option Type = 'Continuation School'`. These may not be equivalent, leading to different sets of rows being considered.\n3. **Null Handling**: The Ground Truth Query explicitly filters out null values for the free rate, which the Prediction Query does not do. This could lead to different results if there are null values in the data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses a join and filtering criteria that may not align with the Ground Truth Query's logic. The use of `schools.school` instead of `Educational Option Type` and the lack of null handling could lead to different results. The Ground Truth Query directly addresses the question by filtering and calculating within the `frpm` table, ensuring the correct context and handling of null values.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 50, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to determine if the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n### Comparison of Queries\n\n1. **Table Joins and Conditions:**\n   - Both queries join the `frpm` and `schools` tables on the `cdscode` column.\n   - Both queries filter for charter schools by checking `T1.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1`.\n   - Both queries filter for schools opened after January 1, 2000, using `T2.opendate > '2000-01-01'`.\n\n2. **Charter Funding Type Condition:**\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `T1.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'`.\n   - The Prediction Query uses `T1.`charter funding type` = 'Direct funded'`.\n\n3. **Column Selection:**\n   - Both queries select the `phone` column from the `schools` table.\n\n### Analysis of Differences\n\n- **Charter Funding Type Condition:**\n  - The key difference lies in the condition for the charter funding type. The Ground Truth Query uses `'Directly funded'`, while the Prediction Query uses `'Direct funded'`.\n  - This difference in the string value for the charter funding type is significant because it affects the filtering condition. If the actual data uses `'Directly funded'`, the Prediction Query will not return the correct results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses an incorrect string value for the charter funding type condition. This discrepancy will lead to different results, as the filtering condition will not match the intended records if the actual data uses `'Directly funded'`.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 52, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Ground Truth Query correctly uses `T1.AvgScrMath > 400`.\n\n2. **Condition on Virtual Schools:**\n   - Both queries use `T2.virtual = 'F'`, which is correct for identifying exclusively virtual schools.\n\n3. **Counting Distinct Schools:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** `COUNT(DISTINCT T1.cds)`\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** `COUNT(DISTINCT T2.School)`\n   \n   Both queries aim to count distinct schools, but the Prediction Query counts distinct `cds` values, while the Ground Truth Query counts distinct `School` names.

This error leads to a completely different set of results, which is why the Prediction Result is `0` instead of `4`.\n\nDue to this significant error, the Prediction Query does not logically answer the Question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 53, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they approach this task.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\nThe Ground Truth Query performs the following steps:\n1. It selects the `CDSCode` from the `frpm` table, ordering by `FRPM Count (K-12)` in descending order and limiting the result to 1. This effectively retrieves the school with the highest FRPM count.\n2. It then uses this `CDSCode` to find the corresponding `NumTstTakr` (number of SAT test takers) from the `satscores` table.\n\nThis query correctly identifies the school with the highest FRPM count and retrieves the number of SAT test takers for that specific school.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\nThe Prediction Query performs the following steps:\n1. It joins the `satscores` table with the `frpm` table on the `cds` and `cdscode` columns.\n2. It orders the results by `frpm count (k-12)` in descending order and limits the result to 1.\n3. It sums the `numtsttakr` values.\n\nThe key differences and issues in the Prediction Query are:\n- The Prediction Query uses a `SUM` function, which is unnecessary and incorrect for this task. The task is to find the number of SAT test takers for a single school, not to sum across multiple schools.\n- The use of `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` in conjunction with `SUM` does not correctly isolate the school with the highest FRPM count before summing, leading to an incorrect result.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not correctly isolate the school with the highest FRPM count before calculating the number of SAT test takers. Instead, it sums the SAT test takers across potentially multiple schools, leading to a significantly different result from the Ground Truth Query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 54, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Prediction Query uses `schools.FundingType`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `frpm.Charter Funding Type`.\n- According to the schema description, `schools.FundingType` and `frpm.Charter Funding Type` are not equivalent. This means the Prediction Query is filtering based on potentially incorrect or irrelevant data for the task.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses the wrong table and column to filter schools based on their charter funding type. This leads to a different result than the Ground Truth Query, which correctly uses the `frpm` table and `Charter Funding Type` column.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 55, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The SAT excellence rate is defined as `NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr`, and the eligible free rate is defined as `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17) / Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`.\n\nLet's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query:\n\n1. **Table Aliases and Joins:**\n   - Both queries join the `satscores` and `frpm` tables using the `cds` and `CDSCode` columns, respectively. This is correct and consistent in both queries.\n\n2. **Condition for SAT Excellence Rate:**\n   - Both queries correctly apply the condition `NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr > 0.3` to filter schools with an SAT excellence rate over 0.3. The Prediction Query uses `T1.numge1500 / T1.numtsttakr > 0.3`, and the Ground Truth Query uses `CAST(T2.NumGE1500 AS REAL) / T2.NumTstTakr > 0.3`. The use of `CAST` in the Ground Truth Query ensures that the division is performed as a floating-point operation, which is important in SQLite to avoid integer division. However, this does not affect the logical correctness of the condition in the Prediction Query, as the division will be correct if the data types are already compatible.\n\n3. **Calculation of Eligible Free Rate:**\n   - The Prediction Query calculates the eligible free rate as `T2.`free meal count (ages 5-17)` / T2.`enrollment (ages 5-17)``.\n   - The Ground Truth Query calculates it as `CAST(T1.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` AS REAL) / T1.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)``. Again, the use of `CAST` ensures floating-point division, which is crucial in SQLite to avoid integer division issues.\n\n4. **Aggregation Function:**\n   - Both queries use `MAX()` to find the highest eligible free rate, which is correct.\n\n5. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The Prediction Result is `None`, while the Ground Truth Result is `0.9049079754601227`. This discrepancy suggests that the Prediction Query might not be correctly handling the data types or the division operation, leading to an incorrect result.\n\nThe main issue with the Prediction Query is the potential for integer division due to the lack of explicit casting to ensure floating-point division. This can lead to incorrect results, especially if the columns involved are integers. The Ground Truth Query addresses this by using `CAST` to ensure the division is performed correctly.\n\nGiven the significant difference in results and the potential for incorrect division in the Prediction Query, it does not logically answer the question as intended.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 56, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The SAT excellence rate is defined as the ratio of `NumGE1500` to `NumTstTakr`.\n\nLet's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query:\n\n1. **Join Condition**:\n   - Both queries correctly join the `satscores` and `schools` tables using the `cds` and `CDSCode` columns, respectively.\n\n2. **Excellence Rate Calculation**:\n   - Both queries calculate the excellence rate as `NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr`. However, the Ground Truth Query explicitly casts `NumGE1500` as a REAL type to ensure floating-point division, while the Prediction Query does not include this cast. This could lead to integer division if `NumGE1500` and `NumTstTakr` are both integers, potentially affecting the result.\n\n3. **Filtering**:\n   - The Prediction Query includes a condition `T1.numtsttakr != 0` to avoid division by zero, which is a good practice. The Ground Truth Query does not include this condition, but it assumes that `NumTstTakr` is non-zero for the relevant records.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**:\n   - Both queries order the results by the excellence rate in descending order and limit the results to the top 3 entries.\n\n5. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The results of the two queries are different, which suggests that the lack of explicit casting in the Prediction Query might have led to incorrect integer division, affecting the order of the results.\n\nThe main issue with the Prediction Query is the potential for integer division, which can significantly alter the calculated excellence rates and thus the final ordering of the schools. This is likely the reason for the discrepancy in results between the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query.\n\nGiven these observations, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not ensure floating-point division, which is crucial for accurately calculating the excellence rate.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 57, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The question specifically asks for the NCES school identification number, so the additional `school` column in the Prediction Query is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of identifying the top schools by enrollment.\n\n- **Ordering and Limiting:**\n  - Both queries order the results by `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` in descending order and limit the results to the top 5, which aligns with the question's requirement.\n\n- **Join Condition:**\n  - Both queries correctly join the `schools` and `frpm` tables using the `CDSCode`.\n\n- **Case Sensitivity:**\n  - The column names in the `ORDER BY` clause differ in case sensitivity (`enrollment (ages 5-17)` vs. `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`), but this does not affect the query's logic or execution in SQLite.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question by correctly identifying the top five schools based on enrollment and providing their NCES school identification numbers. The inclusion of the `school` column does not impact the ability to answer the question, as the primary requirement is to list the NCES school identification numbers, which the Prediction Query does.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 58, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this question.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T1.cdscode) \nFROM schools AS T1 \nINNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.cdscode = T2.cds \nWHERE T1.county = 'Contra Costa' \nAND T1.fundingtype = 'Directly funded' \nAND T2.numtsttakr <= 250\n```\n- **Tables Used**: `schools` and `satscores`.\n- **Join Condition**: `T1.cdscode = T2.cds`.\n- **Filters**:\n  - `T1.county = 'Contra Costa'`: This is incorrect as the question specifies \"Fresno\".\n  - `T1.fundingtype = 'Directly funded'`: This is correct for filtering directly funded schools.\n  - `T2.numtsttakr <= 250`: This correctly filters schools with test takers not more than 250.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(T1.CDSCode) \nFROM frpm AS T1 \nINNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds \nWHERE T1.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded' \nAND T1.`County Name` = 'Fresno' \nAND T2.NumTstTakr <= 250\n```\n- **Tables Used**: `frpm` and `satscores`.\n- **Join Condition**: `T1.CDSCode = T2.cds`.\n- **Filters**:\n  - `T1.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'`: Correctly filters directly funded schools.\n  - `T1.`County Name` = 'Fresno'`: Correctly filters for Fresno county.\n  - `T2.NumTstTakr <= 250`: Correctly filters schools with test takers not more than 250.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **County Filter**: \n   - The Prediction Query incorrectly filters for `Contra Costa` instead of `Fresno`, which is a critical error as it does not address the question's requirement.\n   \n2. **Table Used for County and Funding Type**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses the `schools` table, while the Ground Truth Query uses the `frpm` table. According to the hint, `frpm.`County Name`` is equivalent to `schools.County`, but `schools.FundingType` and `frpm.`Charter Funding Type`` are not equivalent. This suggests that the Ground Truth Query is using the correct table for filtering by funding type.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it filters for the wrong county (`Contra Costa` instead of `Fresno`), which leads to a different and incorrect result. Additionally, it uses the wrong table for the funding type filter, which may also contribute to the discrepancy.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 61, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Prediction Query uses the `city` field from the `schools` table, while the Ground Truth Query uses the `County Name` field from the `frpm` table. The question specifies \"Los Angeles,\" which could refer to either the city or the county, but the Ground Truth Query interprets it as the county.\n- The Prediction Query's use of `COUNT(DISTINCT s.school)` suggests it is counting unique schools, while the Ground Truth Query counts entries in the `frpm` table, which may not directly correspond to unique schools due to potential multiple entries per school.\n\nGiven these differences, the Prediction Query does not align with the Ground Truth Query's interpretation of the question, particularly in terms of location filtering and counting methodology. The Prediction Query's result is significantly different from the Ground Truth Result, indicating a logical discrepancy in addressing the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 62, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This join is unnecessary for answering the question as the required information is already present in the `satscores` table.\n\n- **Column Selection:**\n  - The Ground Truth Query directly selects the `sname` from the `satscores` table, which is the correct approach since the question asks for the school name with the highest number of test takers.\n  - The Prediction Query selects the `school` from the `schools` table, which may not directly correspond to the `sname` in `satscores` due to the unnecessary join.\n\n- **Filtering and Ordering:**\n  - Both queries correctly filter for the county 'Contra Costa' and order by the number of test takers in descending order.\n\n- **Handling of Null Values:**\n  - The Ground Truth Query includes a condition to ensure the school name is not null, which is a good practice to avoid null results. The Prediction Query does not include this condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Prediction Query introduces an unnecessary join and selects the school name from a different table, which may lead to incorrect results. The Ground Truth Query directly and correctly retrieves the school name from the `satscores` table, ensuring it is not null and correctly ordered by the number of test takers.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect as it does not logically answer the question due to the unnecessary join and potential mismatch in selecting the school name.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 63, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, there are significant differences in how these queries are constructed, leading to different results.\n\n### Differences:\n\n1. **Table Joins and Columns:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Joins three tables: `schools`, `satscores`, and `frpm`. It uses `T1.school` to select the school name.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Joins two tables: `satscores` and `frpm`. It uses `T2.School Name` to select the school name.\n\n2. **Condition on Free Meals:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Directly uses `T3.percent (%) eligible free (k-12) > 0.1`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Calculates the percentage as `CAST(T2.Free Meal Count (K-12) AS REAL) / T2.Enrollment (K-12) > 0.1`.\n\n3. **Condition on Test Scores:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Uses `T2.numge1500 >= 1500`, which seems incorrect because it checks if the number of students scoring 1500 or more is at least 1500, which is likely not the intended condition.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses `T1.NumGE1500 > 0`, which checks if there is at least one student with a score of 1500 or more.\n\n### Errors in the Prediction Query:\n\n- **Test Score Condition:** The condition `T2.numge1500 >= 1500` is incorrect. It should check if there is at least one student with a score of 1500 or more, not if the number of such students is 1500 or more.\n- **Free Meals Condition:** The Prediction Query assumes the percentage is directly available, while the Ground Truth Query calculates it from the count and enrollment, which is more aligned with the schema description provided in the hint.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Prediction Query does not logically answer the question due to the incorrect condition on the test scores and the assumption about the free meals percentage. These errors lead to a different and incorrect result compared to the Ground Truth Query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 64, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Prediction Query uses `AVG(T2.avgscrmath) > 400` to filter, while the Ground Truth Query uses `CAST(SUM(T1.AvgScrMath) AS REAL) / COUNT(T1.cds) > 400`. Both methods are logically equivalent for calculating the average.\n\n3. **Output Columns:**\n   - The Prediction Query selects `T1.school` and `T1.fundingtype`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query selects `T1.sname` and `T2.`Charter Funding Type``.\n\n4. **Schema Differences:**\n   - The Prediction Query uses `schools.FundingType`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `frpm.`Charter Funding Type``. The hint indicates these are not equivalent, which means the Prediction Query is using the wrong column for the funding type.\n\n5. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The Prediction Result includes 60 schools, while the Ground Truth Result includes only 6 schools. This significant difference suggests that the Prediction Query is not correctly filtering or joining the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses the wrong column for the funding type and results in a significantly different set of schools due to incorrect filtering or joining logic. The use of `schools.FundingType` instead of `frpm.`Charter Funding Type`` is a critical error, as these columns are not equivalent.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 65, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This is incorrect because the question asks for schools in Monterey County, not just the city of Monterey.\n   - The Ground Truth Query correctly filters schools based on the county being 'Monterey'.\n\n2. **Age Group Filtering**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses the column `frpm count (ages 5-17)` to filter schools with more than 800 free or reduced-price meals. This is incorrect because the question specifies ages 15-17.\n   - The Ground Truth Query does not explicitly filter by age group in the column name, but it assumes the correct column is used for filtering.\n\n3. **School Type Filtering**:\n   - The Prediction Query does not filter by school type, which means it could include non-high schools in the results.\n   - The Ground Truth Query includes a condition `T1.`School Type` = 'High Schools (Public)'` to ensure only high schools are considered, which aligns with the question's requirement.\n\n4. **Column Selection**:\n   - Both queries select the school name and full communication address, but the Prediction Query uses different column names (`S.school`, `S.street`, etc.) compared to the Ground Truth Query (`T1.`School Name``, `T2.Street`, etc.). This difference is acceptable as long as the logical output is correct.\n\nDue to these differences, particularly the incorrect filtering by city instead of county and the lack of filtering by school type, the Prediction Query does not logically answer the question as intended. The Ground Truth Query correctly addresses these aspects, providing the correct result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 66, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Ground Truth Query lists the scores directly, which aligns with the question's requirement to list the score if available.\n\nThe Prediction Query does not logically answer the question as it excludes schools without SAT scores and performs unnecessary aggregation. The Ground Truth Query correctly includes all schools meeting the date criteria and lists the scores if available.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 67, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, the inclusion of the school name does not affect the logical correctness of the query in terms of answering the question about the eligible free rate.\n- **Calculation**: Both queries correctly calculate the eligible free rate using the same formula.\n- **Ordering and Limiting**: Both queries correctly order by enrollment in descending order and use `LIMIT 9, 2` to select the 10th and 11th schools.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question by providing the eligible free rate for the 10th and 11th schools with the highest enrollment, along with the school names. The inclusion of the school name is an additional detail that does not affect the correctness of the query in terms of calculating the eligible free rate.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 70, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Prediction Query uses `soctype`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `SOC`. The correct column based on the schema provided in the hint is `SOC`. Therefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect in this aspect.\n\n2. **Calculation of Free or Reduced Price Meal Rate:**\n   - Both queries calculate the rate as `FRPM Count (K-12) / Enrollment (K-12)`. However, the Ground Truth Query explicitly casts the numerator to a real number to ensure floating-point division, which is important in SQLite3 to avoid integer division.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting:**\n   - Both queries order by `FRPM Count (K-12)` in descending order and limit the results to the top 5, which is correct.\n\n4. **Join Operation:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Uses a subquery to filter `cdscode` from the `schools` table.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses an `INNER JOIN` to combine `frpm` and `schools` tables based on `CDSCode`.\n\n   Both approaches are logically valid for joining the tables, but the filtering issue in the Prediction Query makes it incorrect.\n\n5. **Output Columns:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Selects `school name` and the calculated rate.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Only selects the calculated rate.\n\n   The inclusion of `school name` in the Prediction Query does not affect the correctness regarding the main task, which is to calculate the rate.\n\nThe main issue with the Prediction Query is the incorrect filtering condition using `soctype` instead of `SOC`. This results in a different set of schools being considered, leading to different results.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query does not correctly answer the question due to the incorrect filtering condition.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 71, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this task.\n\n### Schema Analysis\n- **schools** table:\n  - Contains columns like `admfname1`, `admlname1`, `admfname2`, `admlname2`, `admfname3`, `admlname3` for administrator names.\n  - `school` and `CDSCode` are identifiers for schools.\n\n- **satscores** table:\n  - Contains `sname` and `cds` as identifiers for schools.\n  - `NumGE1500` is the column indicating the number of students scoring 1500 or more.\n\n### Comparison of Queries\n\n1. **Join Condition:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Joins `schools` and `satscores` on `T1.school = T2.sname`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Joins `satscores` and `schools` on `T1.cds = T2.CDSCode`.\n\n   The Ground Truth Query uses `cds` and `CDSCode` for joining, which are likely the correct identifiers for matching records between the two tables. The Prediction Query uses `school` and `sname`, which may not correctly match the records, leading to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Selection of Columns:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Selects only `admfname1` and `admlname1`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Selects all possible administrator names (`AdmFName1`, `AdmLName1`, `AdmFName2`, `AdmLName2`, `AdmFName3`, `AdmLName3`).\n\n   The Ground Truth Query correctly accounts for up to three administrators, while the Prediction Query only considers the first administrator, which is insufficient to fully answer the question.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting:**\n   - Both queries order by `NumGE1500` in descending order and limit the result to 1, which is correct for finding the school with the highest number of students scoring 1500 or more.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query fails to correctly join the tables using the appropriate identifiers (`cds` and `CDSCode`) and does not account for all possible administrators. These issues lead to an incorrect result, as evidenced by the `None` values in the Prediction Result. The Ground Truth Query correctly joins the tables and selects all relevant administrator names, providing the correct result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "challenging", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 73, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, there are some differences in their implementation:\n\n1. **Date Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Uses `T2.opendate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31'` to filter schools that opened in 1980. This is a correct approach to filter dates within the year 1980.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses `strftime('%Y', T2.OpenDate) = '1980'` to filter schools that opened in 1980. This is another correct approach to filter by year.\n\n2. **Location Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Filters by `T2.city = 'Fresno'`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Filters by `T2.County = 'Fresno'`.\n\n   The key difference here is the filtering condition for location. The Prediction Query filters by city, while the Ground Truth Query filters by county. This difference is significant because it affects the set of schools considered in the calculation. The question asks for \"Fresno schools,\" which could be interpreted as either city or county, but the Ground Truth Query assumes it refers to the county.\n\n3. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The difference in filtering by city versus county leads to different sets of schools being considered, which results in different average values.\n\nGiven these differences, the Prediction Query does not correctly answer the question as intended by the Ground Truth Query. The use of city instead of county for filtering is a significant error that affects the logical correctness of the query in the context of the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 74, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The difference in column naming (`cdscode` vs. `CDSCode`) is not significant as it is likely due to case sensitivity or naming conventions.\n\n2. **Filtering by District**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query filters schools by `T2.District = 'Fresno Unified'`, which is the correct column to use for district filtering.\n   - The Prediction Query uses `T1.dname = 'Fresno Unified'`, which is incorrect because `dname` is not specified in the schema description and may not correctly represent the district name.\n\n3. **Handling Null Values**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query includes a condition `T1.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL` to ensure that only schools with a valid average reading score are considered. This is important to avoid selecting a school with a null score.\n   - The Prediction Query does not include this condition, which could lead to incorrect results if there are schools with null average reading scores.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**:\n   - Both queries order the results by `T1.avgscrread` (Prediction) or `T1.AvgScrRead` (Ground Truth) in ascending order and limit the result to the first entry, which is correct for finding the school with the lowest average reading score.\n\n5. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The difference in results between the Prediction and Ground Truth Queries is likely due to the incorrect filtering by district in the Prediction Query and the lack of handling for null values.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses an incorrect column for district filtering and does not handle null values, leading to a different and incorrect result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 75, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

It only selects the top 5 schools overall, not within each county. The Ground Truth Query correctly partitions by county and ranks the schools within each county, ensuring that it meets the question's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not logically answer the question as specified.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 76, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

It incorrectly assumes a direct relationship between `frpm` and `satscores` without using the `schools` table to find the educational option type.\n- The Ground Truth Query correctly uses a join between `satscores` and `schools` to find the educational option type, which is necessary to answer the question accurately.\n- The Prediction Query fails to provide the correct result due to the incorrect assumption about table relationships and missing the necessary join operation.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not logically answer the question due to the lack of a proper join and incorrect table usage.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 77, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Both queries aim to find the school with the lowest total score across all subjects (math, reading, and writing).\n  - The Ground Truth Query uses `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT 1` to find the school with the lowest total score, ensuring only one result is returned.\n  - The Prediction Query uses a `WHERE` clause with a subquery to find the minimum total score, which could potentially return multiple rows if there are ties.\n\n- **Handling of NULL values:**\n  - The Ground Truth Query explicitly checks for `T1.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL`, ensuring that only schools with a valid math score are considered.\n  - The Prediction Query does not include this check, which could lead to incorrect results if there are NULL values in the `avgscrmath` column.\n\n- **Potential for Multiple Results:**\n  - The Prediction Query could return multiple rows if multiple schools have the same minimum total score, whereas the Ground Truth Query ensures only one result is returned due to the `LIMIT 1`.\n\n- **Column Naming and Case Sensitivity:**\n  - The column names and case sensitivity are consistent with the schema provided, so there are no issues in this regard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Prediction Query has a significant flaw in that it does not handle the possibility of multiple schools having the same minimum total score, and it does not check for NULL values in the `avgscrmath` column. This could lead to incorrect or incomplete results. The Ground Truth Query correctly handles these aspects by using `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT 1`, and checking for NULL values.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 78, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Both are intended to filter for State Special Schools, but the Ground Truth Query uses a more specific and correct field for this purpose.\n\n2. **Ordering Criteria**:\n   - The Prediction Query orders by `gsserved`, which is not specified to represent enrollment from grades 1 through 12.\n   - The Ground Truth Query orders by `Enrollment (K-12)`, which directly corresponds to the number of enrollees from grades 1 through 12.\n\n3. **Data Source**:\n   - The Prediction Query only uses the `schools` table, while the Ground Truth Query uses a join between `frpm` and `schools` to access the enrollment data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query does not correctly address the question because it orders by `gsserved`, which may not represent the enrollment from grades 1 through 12. The Ground Truth Query correctly uses the `Enrollment (K-12)` field to determine the number of enrollees from grades 1 through 12, which is the focus of the question. Therefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 79, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, there are some differences between the two queries that lead to different results.\n\n1. **Column Reference for DOCType**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `doctype = 'Elementary School District'` to filter the schools, while the Ground Truth Query uses `DOC = 52`. According to the hint, \"Elementary School District\" refers to `DOC = 52`. If the `doctype` column does not directly map to `DOC = 52`, this could lead to a discrepancy in the number of schools counted.\n\n2. **Data Type Casting**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query explicitly casts the count to a REAL type before dividing by 12, which ensures that the division results in a floating-point number. The Prediction Query does not perform this casting, which might lead to integer division in some SQL environments, but since the result is 1, it suggests that the division was handled correctly as a floating-point operation in this case.\n\n3. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The Ground Truth Result is `1.4166666666666667`, while the Prediction Result is `1`. This indicates that the Prediction Query is likely missing some schools that should be counted, possibly due to the filtering condition on `doctype`.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query does not correctly filter the schools based on the \"Elementary School District\" criteria as defined by `DOC = 52`, leading to an incorrect result. The Ground Truth Query correctly uses `DOC = 52` to filter the schools, resulting in a different and likely correct count.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 80, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, there are significant differences in their implementation:\n\n1. **Column Reference for School Type**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `doctype` to identify the type of school district ('Unified School District' and 'Elementary School District').\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `DOC` with specific numeric codes (54 for Unified School District and 52 for Elementary School District).\n\n2. **Condition for Merged Status and County**:\n   - Both queries correctly filter for `statustype = 'Merged'` and `county = 'Orange'` in the Prediction Query, and `StatusType = 'Merged'` and `County = 'Orange'` in the Ground Truth Query. These conditions are equivalent.\n\n3. **Calculation of Ratio**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `SUM(IIF(...))` to count the number of merged schools for each type and then divides these sums.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `SUM(CASE WHEN ...)` to achieve the same counting, but it explicitly casts the numerator to `REAL` to ensure floating-point division.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The Prediction Query results in `0`, indicating that it did not find any merged Unified School District schools or miscounted them.\n   - The Ground Truth Query results in `0.5714285714285714`, suggesting it correctly identified and counted the relevant schools.\n\n5. **Potential Issues**:\n   - The Prediction Query may have failed to correctly identify the school types due to the use of `doctype` instead of `DOC` with numeric codes. This is likely the reason for the discrepancy in results.\n\nGiven these differences, the Prediction Query does not logically answer the Question as it fails to correctly identify and count the relevant school types, leading to an incorrect result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 81, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

It only lists one school due to the `GROUP BY` and `LIMIT 1` clause.\n  - The Ground Truth Query correctly identifies the county with the most closed schools and lists all closed schools in that county.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not provide a complete list of closed schools in the county with the most closures. It only returns one school, which does not fully answer the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 82, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This ensures that only valid scores are considered when determining the lowest average score.\n   - The Prediction Query does not include this condition, which means it might incorrectly consider rows with NULL values as having the lowest score.\n\n5. **Column Naming:**\n   - The Prediction Query uses `mailstrabr` and `school`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `MailStreet` and `School`. This discrepancy in column names could lead to incorrect results if the column names do not match the actual schema.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe key issue with the Prediction Query is the lack of a condition to exclude NULL values in the `avgscrread` column. This omission can lead to incorrect results, as NULL values might be treated as the lowest possible value, resulting in the wrong school being selected. Additionally, the column names used in the Prediction Query (`mailstrabr` and `school`) do not match the expected column names (`MailStreet` and `School`), which could also contribute to the incorrect result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not handle NULL values properly and uses incorrect column names, leading to a different result from the Ground Truth Query. The Ground Truth Query correctly filters out NULL values and uses the correct column names, resulting in the correct school being identified.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 84, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to understand the differences:\n\n1. **Table Aliases and Joins:**\n   - Both queries use an INNER JOIN between the `satscores` and `schools` tables, joining on the `cds` and `CDSCode` columns, respectively. This part is consistent between both queries.\n\n2. **Conditions:**\n   - Both queries filter for schools in Lakeport (`S.mailcity = 'Lakeport'` in the Prediction Query and `T2.MailCity = 'Lakeport'` in the Ground Truth Query).\n   - Both queries calculate the total SAT score as the sum of `AvgScrRead`, `AvgScrMath`, and `AvgScrWrite`, and filter for scores greater than or equal to 1500. This condition is correctly implemented in both queries.\n\n3. **Counting Logic:**\n   - The Ground Truth Query counts the number of `cds` entries that meet the conditions.\n   - The Prediction Query counts the number of distinct `school` entries. This is a significant difference because the Ground Truth Query counts based on the `cds` entries, which may not directly correspond to distinct school names.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The Ground Truth Result is 2, while the Prediction Result is 1. This discrepancy likely arises from the difference in counting logic. The Ground Truth Query counts based on `cds`, which may include multiple entries for the same school, whereas the Prediction Query counts distinct school names.\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it counts distinct school names rather than the number of `cds` entries, leading to a different result. The Ground Truth Query correctly counts the number of `cds` entries that meet the conditions, which aligns with the question's requirement to count the total number of schools.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 85, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The Ground Truth Query, while providing detailed data, does not directly answer the question as it requires further aggregation to get the total.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 86, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

SQLite is case-insensitive for column names, so this difference does not affect the logic.\n\n2. **State Filtering**:\n   - The Prediction Query filters schools with `mailstate = 'California'`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query filters schools with `MailState = 'CA'`.\n   - This is a significant difference because 'California' and 'CA' are not equivalent, leading to different sets of schools being considered in each query.\n\n3. **Counting Logic**:\n   - Both queries use a `CASE` statement to count schools in Colusa and Humboldt counties. However, the Prediction Query uses `COUNT(CASE WHEN county = 'Colusa' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)`, which counts non-null results, while the Ground Truth Query uses `SUM(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`, which sums up 1s and 0s. Both methods are logically equivalent for counting purposes.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy**:\n   - The Prediction Query returns `None`, indicating a division by zero or no matching records, while the Ground Truth Query returns a numeric ratio. This discrepancy is likely due to the difference in state filtering ('California' vs. 'CA').\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses the wrong state filter, which leads to a different set of schools being considered and results in a division by zero or no matching records. The Ground Truth Query correctly filters by 'CA', which is the standard postal abbreviation for California, and produces a valid ratio.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 87, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Both queries aim to find the phone number, extension number, and school name for the school with the zip code '95203-3704'. \n\n### Comparison:\n\n1. **Column Selection and Order:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** `SELECT school, phone, ext FROM schools WHERE zip = '95203-3704'`\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** `SELECT Phone, Ext, School FROM schools WHERE Zip = '95203-3704'`\n   - The only difference is the order of the columns in the SELECT statement. The Prediction Query lists the school name first, while the Ground Truth Query lists the phone number first. This difference in column order does not affect the logical correctness of the query in terms of answering the question.\n\n2. **Condition:**\n   - Both queries use the condition `WHERE zip = '95203-3704'`, which is correct and ensures that the query filters the school based on the specified zip code.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The results from both queries contain the same information, just in a different column order. The Prediction Result and Ground Truth Result both correctly identify the school as \"Spanos (Alex G.) Elementary\" with the phone number \"(209) 933-7470\" and extension \"2222\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Prediction Query is logically correct and answers the question as intended. The difference in column order does not impact the correctness of the query in terms of the information it retrieves. Therefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 89, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

This part of the query is consistent with the requirement to focus on chartered schools with the specified charter number.\n\n2. **Selected Columns:**\n   - The Ground Truth Query selects `AdmFName1`, `AdmLName1`, `School`, and `City`. This directly answers the question by providing the first administrator's first and last name, along with the school and city.\n   - The Prediction Query selects `school`, `city`, `admfname1`, `admlname1`, `admfname2`, `admlname2`, `admfname3`, `admlname3`. This includes additional columns for the second and third administrators' names, which are not required by the question. However, this does not affect the logical correctness of the query as it still provides the necessary information.\n\n3. **Output Structure:**\n   - The Ground Truth Result has four columns, while the Prediction Result has eight columns due to the inclusion of additional administrator name fields. The extra columns in the Prediction Result do not impact the ability to answer the question, as the required information is still present.\n\n4. **Result Comparison:**\n   - The results from both queries contain the same schools and cities, and the first administrator's names match. The additional columns in the Prediction Result are filled with `None` for the second and third administrators, which does not affect the correctness of the answer to the question.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query logically answers the question by providing the necessary information about the first administrator's name, school, and city, even though it includes additional columns. The extra columns do not introduce any errors or inconsistencies in the context of the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 90, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

The join in the Prediction Query is based on the `cdscode` column, which is not necessary for this calculation as per the Ground Truth Query.\n\n2. **Filtering Conditions:**\n   - The Prediction Query filters schools based on `T1.`county name` = 'Santa Clara'`, which is correct for identifying schools in Santa Clara County.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `County = 'Santa Clara' AND Charter = 1`, which ensures that only charter schools in Santa Clara County are considered. The Prediction Query does not include a condition to filter only charter schools, which is a significant oversight.\n\n3. **Calculation of Ratio:**\n   - The Prediction Query calculates the percentage of locally funded schools out of all schools in Santa Clara County, without distinguishing between charter and non-charter schools.\n   - The Ground Truth Query calculates the percentage of locally funded charter schools compared to all other types of charter school funding in Santa Clara County. This is done by dividing the count of locally funded charter schools by the count of non-locally funded charter schools.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The Prediction Result is 30.0, while the Ground Truth Result is approximately 33.33. This discrepancy arises because the Prediction Query does not correctly filter for charter schools, leading to an incorrect denominator in the percentage calculation.\n\nIn summary, the Prediction Query fails to correctly filter for charter schools, which is a critical aspect of the question. This results in an incorrect calculation of the ratio, as it includes non-charter schools in the denominator.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 91, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

However, they produce different results, indicating a discrepancy in their logic or execution.\n\n### Comparison of Queries:\n\n1. **Date Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Uses `opendate BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses `strftime('%Y', OpenDate) BETWEEN '2000' AND '2005'`.\n   - **Analysis:** Both queries aim to filter the same date range, but the Ground Truth Query uses `strftime` to extract the year, which might handle date formats differently. However, this should not cause a discrepancy if the dates are stored in a standard format.\n\n2. **Funding Type:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Filters with `fundingtype = 'Directly Funded'`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Filters with `FundingType = 'Directly funded'`.\n   - **Analysis:** The difference in capitalization ('Funded' vs. 'funded') could be significant if the database is case-sensitive. This is a likely source of discrepancy.\n\n3. **County Filtering:**\n   - Both queries filter for `county = 'Stanislaus'` and `County = 'Stanislaus'`, respectively.\n   - **Analysis:** This condition is consistent across both queries.\n\n4. **Counting Mechanism:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Uses `COUNT(*)`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses `COUNT(School)`.\n   - **Analysis:** This difference should not affect the count unless there are null values in the `School` column, which is unlikely to be the case for counting purposes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe primary issue causing the discrepancy in results is likely the case sensitivity in the `FundingType` condition. The Prediction Query uses 'Directly Funded', while the Ground Truth Query uses 'Directly funded'. If the database is case-sensitive, this would result in the Prediction Query not matching any rows, leading to a count of 0.\n\n### Correction:\n\nTo ensure the Prediction Query matches the Ground Truth Query's logic, the `fundingtype` condition should be adjusted to match the case used in the Ground Truth Query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE opendate BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2005-12-31' AND fundingtype = 'Directly funded' AND county = 'Stanislaus'\n```\n\n### Scoring:\n\nGiven the case sensitivity issue leading to a different result, the Prediction Query is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 92, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to understand the differences and determine if the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n### Comparison of Queries\n\n1. **Filtering by Year:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Uses `closeddate LIKE '1989%'` to filter closures in 1989. This approach assumes that the `closeddate` field is a string formatted in a way that allows this pattern matching to work correctly.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Uses `strftime('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989'` to extract the year from the `ClosedDate` field, ensuring that only closures from 1989 are considered. This method is more robust as it directly extracts the year from a date field.\n\n2. **City Filtering:**\n   - **Prediction Query:** Filters by `city = 'San Francisco, CA'`.\n   - **Ground Truth Query:** Filters by `City = 'San Francisco'`.\n   - The difference in city filtering is significant. The Prediction Query includes the state abbreviation \"CA\" in the city name, which may not match the actual data if the city is recorded as just \"San Francisco\" without the state.\n\n3. **Document Type Filtering:**\n   - Both queries correctly filter for `DOCType = 'Community College District'`.\n\n4. **Counting:**\n   - Both queries use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(School)` to count the number of closures, which is appropriate for the task.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe main issue with the Prediction Query is the filtering condition for the city. By including \"CA\" in the city name, it may not match the actual data if the city is recorded as \"San Francisco\" without the state abbreviation. This discrepancy likely leads to the Prediction Query returning a count of 0, while the Ground Truth Query returns a count of 2.\n\nAdditionally, the method of filtering by year in the Prediction Query relies on the assumption that `closeddate` is a string formatted in a way that allows for pattern matching with `LIKE`. This is less reliable than using `strftime` to extract the year, as done in the Ground Truth Query.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Prediction Query does not logically answer the question due to the incorrect city filtering condition and a less reliable method for filtering by year. These issues result in a different and incorrect result compared to the Ground Truth Query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 93, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to see how they address this task.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.school) \nFROM schools AS s \nINNER JOIN frpm AS f ON s.cdscode = f.cdscode \nWHERE s.county = 'Alpine' \nAND f.`school type` = 'District Community Day Schools' \nAND s.statustype IN ('Active', 'Closed')\n```\n- **Joins**: The query joins the `schools` table with the `frpm` table on the `cdscode` column.\n- **Filters**:\n  - Filters for schools in the county of 'Alpine'.\n  - Filters for schools of type 'District Community Day Schools' from the `frpm` table.\n  - Filters for schools with a status of either 'Active' or 'Closed'.\n- **Count**: Counts distinct schools that meet the above criteria.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(School) \nFROM schools \nWHERE (StatusType = 'Closed' OR StatusType = 'Active') \nAND SOC = 69 \nAND County = 'Alpine'\n```\n- **Filters**:\n  - Filters for schools with a status of either 'Active' or 'Closed'.\n  - Filters for schools in the county of 'Alpine'.\n  - Filters for schools with `SOC = 69`, which is likely a code for 'District Community Day Schools'.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Join with `frpm` Table**: The Prediction Query uses a join with the `frpm` table to filter by `school type`, while the Ground Truth Query uses a direct filter on the `SOC` column in the `schools` table.\n2. **SOC Code**: The Ground Truth Query uses `SOC = 69` to identify 'District Community Day Schools', which is not present in the Prediction Query.\n3. **Result Discrepancy**: The Prediction Query returns a count of 1, while the Ground Truth Query returns a count of 2. This discrepancy suggests that the Prediction Query may not be correctly identifying all relevant schools.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query does not correctly filter for 'District Community Day Schools' using the `SOC` code, which leads to an incorrect count. The join with the `frpm` table and reliance on `school type` may not accurately capture all schools of interest, especially if the `SOC` code is the correct identifier for these schools.\n\nGiven these observations, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it fails to accurately count the number of active and closed District Community Day Schools in Alpine County.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 94, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Assuming these columns are equivalent, the calculation logic is correct in both queries.\n\n2. **Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Both queries filter schools based on the grade span `K-9` and the county `Los Angeles`.\n   - The Prediction Query uses `T1.\\`county name\\`` and `T2.gsserved`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `T2.County` and `T2.GSserved`. According to the hint, `frpm.\\`County Name\\`` and `schools.County` are equivalent, so this part is correct.\n\n3. **Join Condition:**\n   - Both queries perform an INNER JOIN between the `frpm` and `schools` tables using the `cdscode` column, which is correct.\n\n4. **Result Discrepancy:**\n   - The results differ significantly between the two queries. The Prediction Result shows different percentage values compared to the Ground Truth Result for the same schools.\n\n5. **Potential Issue:**\n   - The discrepancy in results suggests that there might be a difference in the data used for the calculation. The hint suggests using `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` for the calculation, which aligns with the Ground Truth Query. The Prediction Query might be using incorrect or differently named columns, leading to incorrect results.\n\nGiven the significant difference in results and the hint provided, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not use the correct column names for the calculation, leading to incorrect percentage values.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 97, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}

Let's compare the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query to understand their differences and determine if the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n### Prediction Query Analysis\n```sql\nSELECT schools.school, schools.latitude, frpm.`school type` \nFROM schools \nJOIN frpm ON schools.cdscode = frpm.cdscode \nWHERE schools.latitude = ( SELECT MAX(latitude) FROM schools )\n```\n- This query joins the `schools` and `frpm` tables on the `cdscode` column.\n- It selects the school name, latitude, and school type for schools with the maximum latitude.\n- The subquery `(SELECT MAX(latitude) FROM schools)` correctly identifies the maximum latitude.\n- The `WHERE` clause filters schools to only those with this maximum latitude.\n- The result includes multiple rows if there are ties in the maximum latitude.\n\n### Ground Truth Query Analysis\n```sql\nSELECT T1.`School Type`, T1.`School Name`, T2.Latitude \nFROM frpm AS T1 \nINNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode \nORDER BY T2.Latitude DESC \nLIMIT 1\n```\n- This query also joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables on the `CDSCode` column.\n- It orders the results by latitude in descending order and limits the output to the top row, effectively selecting the school with the highest latitude.\n- It selects the school type, school name, and latitude.\n\n### Comparison\n- **Result Set**: The Prediction Query returns two rows because there are two schools with the same maximum latitude, while the Ground Truth Query returns only one row due to the `LIMIT 1` clause.\n- **Columns**: Both queries select the same logical information: school type, school name, and latitude, though the order of columns differs.\n- **Handling Ties**: The Prediction Query correctly handles ties by returning all schools with the maximum latitude, which is logically consistent with the question's requirement to identify the school with the highest latitude.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question by identifying all schools with the maximum latitude, which is a valid interpretation of the task. The Ground Truth Query limits the result to one school, which is another valid approach. The difference in the number of rows is due to the handling of ties, which is acceptable given the question's ambiguity.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 0, "human_judge": 0.6666666667, "eval_index": 98, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"}
