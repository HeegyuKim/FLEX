It correctly answers the question by listing the codes of schools with a total enrollment of over 500.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 5, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

It does not miss any critical conditions or introduce any errors that would affect the outcome. The use of `1.0` in the Prediction Query ensures that the division is treated as a floating-point operation, similar to the `CAST` in the Ground Truth Query.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 6, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

It applies the same conditions on `Free Meal Count (K-12)` and `FRPM Count (K-12)`.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses an INNER JOIN to ensure that only schools in Los Angeles are considered, which is logically equivalent to filtering directly on `County Name` in the `frpm` table, given the hint that `frpm.County Name` and `schools.County` are equivalent.\n   - Both queries apply the same conditions on `Free Meal Count (K-12)` and `FRPM Count (K-12)`.\n\n5. **Result Equivalence**: The note states that both queries have the same execution results, indicating that the JOIN operation in the Prediction Query does not introduce any discrepancies in the result.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The Prediction Query correctly answers the question by ensuring that only schools in Los Angeles are considered and applying the correct conditions on meal counts. The use of an INNER JOIN does not affect the correctness of the result.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 9, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

This is correct as it links the school information with their SAT scores.\n\n2. **Selection and Ordering**:\n   - Both queries select the `EdOpsName` from the `schools` table, which represents the type of education offered.\n   - Both queries order the results by `AvgScrMath` in descending order to find the school with the highest average Math score.\n\n3. **Limiting Results**:\n   - Both queries use `LIMIT 1` to ensure only the top result (the school with the highest average Math score) is returned.\n\n4. **Alias Usage**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses table aliases (`T1` and `T2`), while the Prediction Query does not. However, this does not affect the correctness of the query.\n\n5. **Logical Correctness**:\n   - Both queries logically answer the question by correctly identifying the school with the highest average Math score and retrieving the type of education offered.\n\nGiven that both queries produce the same result and logically answer the question correctly, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 16, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Indicate the city where the school is situated.\n\n**Schema Information:**\n- `satscores` table contains columns `AvgScrWrite` (average writing score) and `NumGE1500` (number of test takers with SAT scores >= 1500).\n- `schools` table contains columns `City` and `CDSCode` (used to join with `satscores`).\n\n**Prediction Query Analysis:**\n- The query joins `satscores` and `schools` on the `cds` and `CDSCode` columns, which is correct.\n- It orders the results by `NumGE1500` in descending order to find the school with the highest number of test takers with scores >= 1500.\n- It selects `AvgScrWrite` and `City`, which are the required outputs.\n- It uses `LIMIT 1` to ensure only the top result is returned, which is appropriate for finding the school with the highest number of qualifying test takers.\n\n**Ground Truth Query Analysis:**\n- The Ground Truth Query performs the same operations as the Prediction Query, with the same logic and structure.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both queries are logically equivalent and perform the same operations to answer the question.\n- The Prediction Query correctly identifies the school with the highest number of test takers with scores >= 1500 and retrieves the required information.\n\nGiven this analysis, the Prediction Query is correct and meets the requirements of the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 17, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

The use of `COUNT` with `NULL` and `SUM` with `0` are equivalent in this context for counting purposes.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 21, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Since the `School` column is likely not nullable, both queries will produce the same result.\n\nThe prediction query correctly implements the logic required to answer the question. It does not miss any critical conditions or introduce any errors that would affect the result. The use of `COUNT(*)` is acceptable here as it will produce the same result as `COUNT(T2.School)` given the context.\n\nTherefore, the prediction query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "challenging", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 0.5, "eval_index": 24, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Let's analyze the Prediction Query:\n\n1. **Table Used**: Both queries use the `schools` table, which is correct as the question pertains to school closures.\n\n2. **Conditions**:\n   - **City**: Both queries filter for `City = 'San Francisco'`, which is correct.\n   - **DOCType**: Both queries filter for `DOCType = 'Community College District'`, which is correct.\n   - **Year of Closure**: Both queries use `strftime('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989'` to filter for closures in the year 1989, which is correct.\n\n3. **Count Function**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `COUNT(*)`, while the Ground Truth Query uses `COUNT(School)`. In this context, using `COUNT(*)` is acceptable because it counts all rows that meet the conditions, and there is no indication that the `School` column can be NULL. Therefore, both should yield the same result.\n\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question and does not contain any significant errors. It correctly filters the data and counts the number of closures as required by the question. The use of `COUNT(*)` instead of `COUNT(School)` does not affect the correctness in this scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 0.5, "eval_index": 27, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Let's analyze the differences and their implications:\n\n1. **SOCType vs SOC**: \n   - The Prediction Query uses `SOCType = 'District Community Day Schools'`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `SOC = 69`.\n   - The hint suggests that `SOC` and `SOCType` are related, but it does not explicitly confirm that `SOCType = 'District Community Day Schools'` is equivalent to `SOC = 69`. However, since both queries produce the same result, it implies that these conditions are equivalent in this context.\n\n2. **COUNT(*) vs COUNT(School)**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `COUNT(*)`, which counts all rows that satisfy the conditions.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `COUNT(School)`, which counts non-null values in the `School` column. If `School` is not nullable, these two counts will be equivalent. The schema does not indicate that `School` is nullable, so this difference does not affect the result.\n\n3. **Logical Conditions**:\n   - Both queries correctly filter for schools that are either 'Active' or 'Closed' and located in the county of 'Alpine'.\n\nGiven that both queries produce the same result and the differences do not affect the logical correctness of the query in this context, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 30, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

However, there are some differences in the conditions used to filter the data:\n\n1. **School Type Condition:**\n   - The Prediction Query uses `schools.EdOpsName = 'Youth Authority School'`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `T2.SOCType = 'Youth Authority Facilities'`.\n\n2. **Mailing Address Condition:**\n   - The Prediction Query uses `schools.MailStrAbr = 'PO Box 1040'`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `T2.MailStreet = 'PO Box 1040'`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The Prediction Query uses `EdOpsName` to filter for 'Youth Authority School', while the Ground Truth Query uses `SOCType` to filter for 'Youth Authority Facilities'. These may refer to different columns or categorizations within the schema, potentially leading to different results if the data in these columns differ.\n  \n- The Prediction Query uses `MailStrAbr` for the address, while the Ground Truth Query uses `MailStreet`. If these columns contain different data or formats, this could also lead to different results.\n\n- Despite these differences, the note states that both queries produce the same execution results, which suggests that the data in the relevant columns might be aligned in such a way that both queries return the same result for the given conditions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the Prediction Query may not be logically equivalent to the Ground Truth Query due to the differences in filtering conditions. However, since the execution results are the same, it indicates that the specific data set used does not differentiate between these conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Prediction Query is incorrect because it does not logically match the conditions specified in the Ground Truth Query, which are more aligned with the question's requirements. The differences in column usage for filtering could lead to different results in a different data set.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 31, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

This is correct as it aligns with the question's requirement to find the most common grade span.\n\n2. **FROM Clause**: The query uses the `schools` table, which is appropriate since the question pertains to the grade spans served by schools.\n\n3. **WHERE Clause**: The query filters the results to only include rows where `schools.City` is 'Adelanto'.

The condition `(schools.County = 'San Diego' OR schools.County = 'Santa Barbara')` correctly filters the counties of interest.\n\n3. **Aggregation and Grouping**: The query uses `COUNT(schools.CDSCode)` to count the number of schools per county, which is equivalent to counting `Virtual` as in the Ground Truth Query, given the context that we are only interested in schools where `Virtual = 'F'`.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**: The query orders the results by the count of schools in descending order and limits the result to 1, which is correct to find the county with the most such schools.\n\n5. **Result Equivalence**: The execution results of both queries are the same, indicating that the logic of the Prediction Query is correct.\n\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question and does not contain any significant errors.

It does not miss any critical conditions or introduce any errors that would affect the result. The use of `LIMIT 1` is appropriate here because the question asks for the accounts with the lowest approved amount, and ordering by `loan.amount` ensures that the lowest amount is selected.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 38, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Let's analyze the differences and similarities between the two queries:\n\n1. **Table Joins and Conditions**:\n   - Both queries join the `client` and `district` tables on the `district_id` column.\n   - Both queries filter for female customers (`gender = 'F'`).\n   - Both queries filter for customers in the district of Sokolov (`A2 = 'Sokolov'`).\n\n2. **Date Condition**:\n   - The prediction query uses `client.birth_date < '1950-01-01'` to filter customers born before 1950.\n   - The ground truth query uses `STRFTIME('%Y', T2.birth_date) < '1950'` to achieve the same condition.\n\n3. **COUNT Function**:\n   - Both queries count the number of clients that satisfy the conditions using `COUNT(client.client_id)`.\n\nThe main difference is in how the birth date condition is handled. The prediction query directly compares the birth date to a specific date, while the ground truth query extracts the year from the birth date and compares it to 1950. Both approaches are logically equivalent in this context, as they both effectively filter for customers born before 1950.\n\nSince both queries produce the same result and logically answer the question correctly, the prediction query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 40, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

The Ground Truth Query also explicitly joins the `account` table, but this is not necessary for the logic of the query since the `account_id` is already accessible through the `disp` table in the Prediction Query.\n\n2. **Filtering Condition**:\n   - Both queries filter the `card` table by the `issued` date '1996-10-21'. This condition is correctly applied in both queries.\n\n3. **Aggregation and Sorting**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `MAX(trans.amount)` to directly find the maximum transaction amount, which is efficient and correct for the question.\n   - The Ground Truth Query orders the transaction amounts in descending order and limits the result to 1, which also effectively finds the maximum amount but is less efficient.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - Both queries produce the same result, as confirmed by the note.\n\nThe Prediction Query is logically correct and efficiently answers the question by directly using the `MAX` function to find the largest transaction amount. The Ground Truth Query achieves the same result but in a less efficient manner by sorting and limiting the results.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 44, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Let's analyze the Prediction Query:\n\n1. **Tables and Joins**: \n   - The Prediction Query uses an `INNER JOIN` between the `schools` and `satscores` tables on the condition `schools.cdscode = satscores.cds`. This is correct as it matches the Ground Truth Query and is necessary to combine information about schools and their SAT scores.\n\n2. **Conditions**:\n   - The condition `satscores.numtsttakr > 500` ensures that only schools with more than 500 SAT test takers are considered. This matches the requirement in the question.\n   - The condition `schools.magnet = 1` ensures that only magnet schools or those offering a magnet program are selected. This is also correct as per the question's requirement.\n\n3. **Selected Columns**:\n   - The Prediction Query selects `schools.school`, which is equivalent to `T2.School` in the Ground Truth Query. This is the correct column to select as it represents the names of the schools.\n\n4. **Logical Correctness**:\n   - The Prediction Query logically answers the question by filtering schools based on the number of SAT test takers and whether they are magnet schools, which is exactly what the question asks for.\n\n5. **Handling of NULL Values**:\n   - The query does not involve any aggregation functions that could be affected by NULL values, so there are no concerns in this regard.\n\nOverall, the Prediction Query is correct and produces the same result as the Ground Truth Query. It correctly implements the logic required to answer the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 52, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

This is necessary to link the SAT scores to the corresponding schools.\n\n2. **Filtering and Conditions**: The query uses a subquery to find the maximum value of `numge1500` from the `satscores` table. It then filters the results to find the school(s) with this maximum number of test takers scoring over 1500.\n\n3. **Selection**: The query selects the `phone` column from the `schools` table, which is the required information.\n\n4. **LIMIT Clause**: The query includes a `LIMIT 1` clause to ensure only one result is returned, which is appropriate since the question asks for the school with the highest number of test takers.\n\nNow, let's compare it with the Ground Truth Query:\n\n- The Ground Truth Query also joins the `satscores` and `schools` tables correctly.\n- It orders the results by `NumGE1500` in descending order and uses `LIMIT 1` to get the school with the highest number of test takers scoring over 1500.\n- Both queries effectively achieve the same result, as they both return the phone number of the school with the highest number of test takers scoring over 1500.\n\nThe Prediction Query is logically correct and produces the same result as the Ground Truth Query. It correctly identifies the school with the highest number of test takers scoring over 1500 and retrieves its phone number.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 53, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Both queries aim to find the FRPM count for students aged 5-17 for the school with the highest average score in Reading in the SAT test. \n\nLet's break down the components:\n\n1. **Table Joins and Conditions**:\n   - Both queries perform an INNER JOIN between the `satscores` table (aliased as T1) and the `frpm` table (aliased as T2) on the condition `T1.cds = T2.cdscode`. This join condition is correct and ensures that the data from both tables are matched based on the school codes.\n\n2. **Ordering and Limiting**:\n   - Both queries order the results by `T1.avgscrread` in descending order, which correctly identifies the school with the highest average reading score.\n   - Both queries use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which is the school with the highest average reading score.\n\n3. **Column Selection**:\n   - Both queries select the column `frpm count (ages 5-17)` from the `frpm` table, which is the required information according to the question.\n\n4. **Case Sensitivity**:\n   - SQLite is case-insensitive for column and table names, so the difference in case between the Prediction Query and the Ground Truth Query does not affect the result.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query correctly answers the question and is logically equivalent to the Ground Truth Query. The execution results are the same, confirming the correctness of the Prediction Query.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 54, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

This is correct as it links the schools with their corresponding SAT scores.\n\n2. **Selection and Ordering**:\n   - Both queries select the `phone` column from the `schools` table.\n   - Both queries order the results by `avgscrmath` in descending order to get the school with the highest average Math score.\n\n3. **Limiting Results**:\n   - Both queries use `LIMIT 1` to ensure only the top result (the school with the highest average Math score) is returned.\n\n4. **Column References**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `avgscrmath` directly, which matches the column used in the Ground Truth Query (`T2.AvgScrMath`). This is correct.\n\n5. **Alias Usage**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses table aliases (`T1` and `T2`), while the Prediction Query does not. However, this does not affect the correctness of the query.\n\n6. **Result Consistency**:\n   - Both queries produce the same result, indicating that the logic and execution are aligned.\n\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question and does not contain any significant errors. It correctly identifies the phone number of the school with the highest average Math score.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 57, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

However, since the join condition ensures that only matching rows are considered, this difference does not affect the result.\n\nThe key difference is the use of the `schools` table in the Ground Truth Query, which ensures that only valid school entries are considered by joining on `CDSCode`.

Therefore, the Ground Truth Query aligns more closely with the question's intent.\n\n4. **Result Equivalence**:\n   - Despite the logical difference, the hint states that both queries produce the same execution results. This suggests that in the dataset, there are no cases where the difference is negative and greater than 30 in absolute value.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query does not logically align with the question's requirement to consider only positive differences. However, since the results are the same, it indicates that the dataset does not have any negative differences that would affect the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect due to the logical discrepancy in handling the difference condition.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 59, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

The Prediction Query uses backticks around column names, which is acceptable in SQL for handling spaces in column names.\n2. The Prediction Query uses an alias `S` for the `schools` table and `F` for the `frpm` table, while the Ground Truth Query uses `T1` and `T2`. This does not affect the logic of the query.\n3. The Prediction Query does not explicitly cast the division result to a REAL type, but this is not necessary for correctness in SQLite3, as the division will automatically result in a REAL type if needed.\n\nBoth queries correctly join the `schools` and `frpm` tables on the `CDSCode` and filter for the school run by Kacey Gibson using the `AdmFName1` and `AdmLName1` columns.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 61, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

However, the question does not specify how to handle ties, so both approaches are acceptable.\n\n5. **Correctness**: Both queries logically answer the question, and since the execution results are the same, the prediction query is correct in this context.\n\nGiven these points, the prediction query is correct and provides the intended result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 65, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Therefore, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "moderate", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 66, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Let's analyze the queries:\n\n1. **Schema and Joins**: Both queries correctly join the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the `cds` and `CDSCode` columns, respectively. This is necessary to access the phone and extension numbers from the `schools` table.\n\n2. **Ordering and Limiting**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `ORDER BY T1.AvgScrWrite DESC LIMIT 332, 1`, which means it orders the results by the average writing score in descending order and skips the first 332 rows, then selects the next row (the 333rd row).\n   - The Prediction Query uses `ORDER BY sat.avgscrwrite DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 332`, which also orders the results by the average writing score in descending order, skips the first 332 rows, and selects the next row (the 333rd row).\n\n3. **Result**: Both queries effectively retrieve the same row, which is the 333rd highest average writing score, and then select the phone and extension numbers from that row.\n\n4. **SQLite Compatibility**: Both queries are compatible with SQLite syntax, and the use of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in the Prediction Query is a valid alternative to the `LIMIT 332, 1` syntax in the Ground Truth Query.\n\nThe Prediction Query correctly answers the question by retrieving the phone and extension numbers for the school with the 333rd highest average writing score. The use of `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 332` is equivalent to `LIMIT 332, 1` in this context, and both achieve the same result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 68, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

Both queries aim to count the number of schools in the 'schools' table where the 'MailCity' is 'Hickman' and the 'CharterNum' is '00D4'. \n\nKey points to consider:\n- Both queries use the same filtering conditions: `mailcity = 'Hickman'` and `charternum = '00D4'`.\n- The difference in column case sensitivity (`charternum` vs `CharterNum` and `mailcity` vs `MailCity`) is not an issue in SQLite, as it is case-insensitive with respect to column names.\n- The use of `COUNT(charternum)` in the Prediction Query versus `COUNT(*)` in the Ground Truth Query does not affect the result as long as `charternum` is not nullable. If `charternum` were nullable, it could potentially affect the count, but the question implies that it is not an issue here since both queries produce the same result.\n\nGiven these considerations, the Prediction Query correctly answers the question.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 0.0, "eval_index": 73, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

In SQLite, this comparison is allowed and will yield the same result as long as the values are numerically equivalent.\n- The question specifies \"with a School Ownership Code that are part of the State Special Schools,\" which is correctly interpreted as `SOC = 31` in both queries.\n\nSince the Prediction Query logically answers the question and produces the same result as the Ground Truth Query, it is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 75, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

The column name is case-sensitive, but both queries use the same column name.\n\n2. **Table Joins**: Both queries perform an INNER JOIN between the `frpm` and `schools` tables on the `cdscode` column.

The prediction query directly matches the academic year as a string, which is correct given the context of the question. The ground truth query uses a BETWEEN condition, which is logically equivalent in this context since the academic year is specified as '2014-2015'.\n\n4. **Result**: Both queries produce the same result, indicating that the prediction query correctly retrieves the desired data.\n\nThe prediction query logically answers the question and produces the correct result.

However, there are some differences in the conditions used in the WHERE clause:\n\n1. **School Type Condition**:\n   - The Prediction Query uses `T2.edopsname = 'Youth Authority School'`.\n   - The Ground Truth Query uses `T2.SOCType = 'Youth Authority Facilities'`.\n\n2. **Mailing Street Condition**:\n   - Both queries use the condition `T2.mailstreet = 'PO Box 1040'`.\n\nThe key difference is in the condition for the school type. The Prediction Query uses `edopsname` while the Ground Truth Query uses `SOCType`. The Ground Truth Query is more specific to the schema provided, as it uses `SOCType` which is likely the correct column to identify the type of school as \"Youth Authority Facilities\".\n\nDespite this difference, the execution results of both queries are the same, which suggests that the data in the database might be such that both conditions effectively filter the same records. However, this does not guarantee that the Prediction Query is logically correct in all scenarios, as it relies on a different column for identifying the school type.\n\nGiven the schema and the question, the Ground Truth Query is more aligned with the expected logic, as it uses the `SOCType` column which is likely intended for identifying the type of school.\n\nTherefore, the Prediction Query is incorrect because it uses a different column (`edopsname`) that may not be equivalent to `SOCType` for identifying \"Youth Authority Facilities\".\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": false}\n```", "judge_result": false, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 0.5, "eval_index": 78, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

This implies:\n1. We need to find accounts that have a corresponding entry in the loan table, indicating they are eligible for loans.\n2. The accounts must be located in the region of Prague, which is determined by the district information.\n\n**Schema Analysis:**\n- `account` table: Contains `account_id` and `district_id`.\n- `district` table: Contains `district_id` and `a3` (region).\n- `loan` table: Contains `account_id`.\n\n**Ground Truth Query Analysis:**\n- The Ground Truth Query correctly joins the `account`, `loan`, and `district` tables.\n- It filters for accounts in the region 'Prague' using `T3.A3 = 'Prague'`.\n- It counts the number of accounts that have a corresponding loan and are in Prague.\n\n**Prediction Query Analysis:**\n- The Prediction Query also joins the `account`, `loan`, and `district` tables.\n- It filters for accounts in the region 'Prague' using `district.a3 = 'Prague'`.\n- It counts distinct `account_id` from the `account` table, ensuring that only unique accounts are counted.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both queries join the same tables and apply the same filter condition for the region 'Prague'.\n- Both queries ensure that only accounts with a corresponding entry in the `loan` table are counted.\n- The use of `COUNT(DISTINCT account.account_id)` in the Prediction Query ensures that only unique accounts are counted, which aligns with the Ground Truth Query's logic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Prediction Query logically answers the question and matches the Ground Truth Query in terms of logic and result.

It returns '1996' if the average for 1996 is greater, otherwise '1995'.\n   - The use of `DISTINCT` in the Ground Truth Query does not affect the result since the `IIF` function will return a single value.\n\n4. **Prediction Query Analysis**:\n   - The Prediction Query also calculates the average unemployment rates for 1995 (`A12`) and 1996 (`A13`) and uses the `IIF` function to compare them. It returns '1995' if the average for 1995 is greater, otherwise '1996'.\n   - The logic of the `IIF` function in the Prediction Query is reversed compared to the Ground Truth Query. However, since the question asks which year has a higher percentage, the logic in the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - Both queries correctly calculate the average unemployment rates for the specified years and compare them.\n   - The use of `DISTINCT` in the Ground Truth Query is not necessary for the correctness of the result.\n   - The logic in the `IIF` function in the Prediction Query is correct for the question asked.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Prediction Query logically answers the question correctly and produces the same result as the Ground Truth Query.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Prediction Query is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 84, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

We need to find the accounts with the earliest trading date in 1995.\n\n2. **Schema Analysis**:\n   - The `trans` table contains the `date` column, which is used to filter and order the transactions.\n   - The `account` table contains the `account_id`, which is needed to identify the accounts.\n\n3. **Ground Truth Query Analysis**:\n   - The Ground Truth Query selects `account_id` from the `trans` table where the year of the `date` is 1995.\n   - It orders the results by `date` in ascending order and limits the result to the first entry, which corresponds to the earliest date in 1995.\n\n4. **Prediction Query Analysis**:\n   - The Prediction Query selects `account_id` from the `account` table, joining it with the `trans` table on `account_id`.\n   - It filters the transactions to those in 1995 using `STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) = '1995'`.\n   - It orders the results by `T2.date` and limits the result to the first entry, which corresponds to the earliest date in 1995.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - Both queries effectively filter transactions to those in 1995 and order by date to find the earliest one.\n   - The Prediction Query includes a join with the `account` table, which is not necessary for the question but does not affect the correctness of the result since it still retrieves the correct `account_id`.\n   - Both queries use `LIMIT 1` to ensure only the earliest date is considered.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Prediction Query correctly identifies the account with the earliest trading date in 1995, despite the additional join, which does not alter the result.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Prediction Query is logically correct and answers the question as intended.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 88, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

DESC LIMIT 1`, which also effectively retrieves the maximum value but through sorting and limiting.\n\n4. **Result Equivalence**:\n   - Both approaches are valid for finding the maximum transaction amount, and since the results are the same, the Prediction Query is logically correct.\n\n5. **SQLite3 Compatibility**:\n   - Both queries are compatible with SQLite3, and there are no issues with integer division or logical operators.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prediction Query correctly answers the question by finding the maximum transaction amount for the specified card issuance date. The use of `MAX` is a direct and efficient way to achieve the desired result.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 92, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}

The join is redundant but does not change the outcome.\n\n5. **Result Consistency:**\n   - Both queries produce the same result, indicating that the additional join in the Prediction Query does not alter the final output.\n\nGiven these points, the Prediction Query, despite having an unnecessary join, logically answers the question correctly and produces the same result as the Ground Truth Query. Therefore, it is considered correct.\n\n```json\n{\"correct\": true}\n```", "judge_result": true, "hardness": "simple", "ex": 1, "human_judge": 1.0, "eval_index": 98, "judge_model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06-no-result"}
